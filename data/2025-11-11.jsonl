In this context, we focus on fully automatic code optimization techniques that automate the process of selecting and applying code transformations for better performance without manual intervention. Understanding how these transformations behave and interact is key to designing more effective optimization strategies. Compiler developers must make numerous design choices when constructing these heuristics. For instance, they may decide whether to allow transformations to be explored in any arbitrary order or to enforce a fixed sequence. While the former may theoretically offer the best performance gains, it significantly increases the search space. This raises an important question: Can a predefined, fixed order of applying transformations speed up the search without severely compromising optimization potential? In this paper, we address this and other related questions that arise in the design of automatic code optimization algorithms. Using a data-driven approach, we generate a large dataset of random programs, apply random optimization sequences, and record their execution times. Through statistical analysis, we provide insights that guide the development of more efficient automatic code optimization algorithms."}

Optimizing transmit beamforming and power splitting in such systems faces formidable challenges, e.g., time-varying channels and multi-tier interference, which create a complex decision landscape where conventional model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) suffers from sample inefficiency due to rarely-encountered state transitions and poor coordination as decentralized agents act independently. This paper proposes the Decentralized World Model with Reasoning Offloading (DWM-RO) framework to address these fundamental limitations. Specifically, each agent employs a world model to learn compact predictive representations of environment dynamics, enabling imagination-based policy training that dramatically reduces required environment interactions. An uncertainty-aware offloading gate monitors local interference levels and model reconstruction errors to trigger selective edge coordination. When activated, a lightweight latent decorrelation mechanism at the edge refines agents' strategic representations, guiding them toward orthogonal actions that minimize resource conflicts. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DWM-RO converges 5 times faster than state-of-the-art baselines while achieving 34.7% higher spectral efficiency and reducing constraint violations by 40%. In dense network scenarios with 10 users, DWM-RO maintains violation rates below 20% while baselines exceed 70%, validating superior robustness."}

By employing several optimization schemes, STAR can be efficiently integrated into the existing I/O datapath of an SSD controller with negligible timing overhead. To evaluate the proposed STAR scheme, we developed a STAR-aware SSD emulator based on characterization results from 160 real 3D NAND flash chips.

Grids have managed the resulting surges by scaling generation capacity, incorporating additional resources such as solar and wind, and implementing demand-response mechanisms. Altogether, these policies influence a region's carbon intensity by affecting its energy mix. To mitigate the environmental impacts of consumption, carbon-aware optimizations often rely on long-horizon, high-accuracy forecasts of the grid's carbon intensity that typically use compute intensive models with extensive historical energy mix data. In addition to limiting scalability, accuracy improvements do not necessarily translate into proportional increases in savings. Highlighting the need for more efficient forecasting strategies, we argue that carbon forecasting solutions can achieve the majority of savings without requiring highly precise and complex predictions. Instead, it is the preservation of the ranking of forecasts relative to the ground-truth that drives realized savings. In this paper, we present LiteCast, a lightweight time series forecasting method capable of quickly modeling a region's energy mix to estimate its carbon intensity. LiteCast requires only a few days of historical energy and weather data, delivering fast forecasts that can quickly adapt to sudden changes in the electrical grid. Our evaluation in 50 worldwide regions under various real-world workloads shows that LiteCast outperforms state-of-the-art forecasters, delivering 20% higher savings with near-optimal performance, achieving 97% of the maximum attainable average savings, while remaining lightweight, efficient to run, and adaptive to new data."}

Despite these benefits, challenges such as startup latencies, static configurations, sub-optimal resource allocation and scheduling still exist due to coupled resource offering and workload-agnostic generic scheduling behaviour. These issues often lead to inconsistent function performance and unexpected operational costs for users and service providers. This paper introduces Saarthi, a novel, end-to-end serverless framework that intelligently manages the dynamic resource needs of function workloads, representing a significant step toward self-driving serverless platforms. Unlike platforms that rely on static resource configurations, Saarthi is input-aware, allowing it to intelligently anticipate resource requirements based on the characteristics of an incoming request payload. This input-driven approach reinforces function right-sizing and enables smart request orchestration across available function configurations. Saarthi further integrates a proactive fault-tolerant redundancy mechanism and employs a multi-objective Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to maintain an optimal function quantity. This optimisation aims to maximise system throughput while simultaneously reducing overall operational costs. We validate the effectiveness of Saarthi by implementing it as a framework atop OpenFaaS.

While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).\n  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%).

To tackle this, the literature has explored heterogeneous systems that combine neural processing units (NPUs) with DRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) for LLM acceleration.

In this paper, we introduce P3-LLM, a novel NPU-PIM integrated accelerator for LLM inference using hybrid numerical formats. Our approach is threefold: First, we propose a flexible mixed-precision quantization scheme, which leverages hybrid numerical formats to quantize different LLM operands with high compression efficiency and minimal accuracy loss. Second, we architect an efficient PIM accelerator co-design for P3-LLM, featuring lightweight compute units to support our hybrid numerical formats. The enhanced PIM compute units significantly boost the computation throughput under iso-area constraints. Third, we optimize the low-precision dataflow of different LLM modules by applying operator fusion to minimize the overhead of runtime dequantization. Our evaluation on a diverse set of representative LLMs and tasks demonstrates that P3-LLM achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy in terms of both KV-cache-only quantization and weight-activation quantization.

However, limited by computation capacity of CPU device and traditional solvers, conventional iteration methods are inefficient in complicated case with textured surface requiring refined mesh, and could not handle simulation during multiple periods. To accelerate Picard iteration for predicting dynamics of APP, a GPU-boosted high-performance Multi-working condition joint Analysis Framework (GMAF) is designed, which adopts Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method (PCG) using Approximate Symmetric Successive Over-Relaxation preconditioner (ASSOR). GMAF abundantly utilizes GPU device via elevating computational intensity and expanding scale of massive parallel computation. Therefore, it possesses novel performance in analyzing dynamics of both smooth and textured APPs during multiple periods, as the establishment and solution to joint algebraic system for pressure field are accelerated magnificently, as well as numerical integral for force and moment due to oil flow. Compared with asynchronized convergence strategy pursuing local convergence, synchronized convergence strategy targeting global convergence is adopted in PCG solver for the joint system. Revealed by corresponding results, oil force in axial direction and moment in circumferential directly respond to input pressure, while other components evolve in sinusoidal patterns. Specifically, force and moment due to normal pressure instantly reach their steady state initially, while ones due to viscous shear stress evolve during periods. After simulating dynamics of APP and pressure distribution via GMAF, the promotion of pressure capacity and torsion resistance due to textured surface is revealed numerically, as several 'steps' exist in the pressure field corresponding to textures."}

It is often a bottleneck for performance and energy efficiency, especially in edge environments with tight resource and power constraints. AMD's Versal ACAP offers heterogeneous components (AIEs, PL, PS) that can address these challenges, but mapping GEMM across them is complex, with prior works largely overlooking energy-performance trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for Versal ACAP that generates GEMM mappings optimized for either performance or energy efficiency. Unlike prior analytical approaches, our method leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model, trained on approximately 6000 on-board experiments of different GEMM mappings, to guide Design Space Exploration, yielding more efficient designs. Evaluation on the Versal VCK190 shows geomean improvements of 1.23x (up to 2.5x) in throughput and 1.25x (up to 2.7x) in energy efficiency over state-of-the-art frameworks."}

Ensuring reliability and global consistency across these layers remains a major challenge, especially for AI-driven workloads requiring real-time, adaptive coordination. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Active Inference Resilience Agent (PAIR-Agent) to achieve resilience in DCC systems. PAIR-Agent performs three core operations: (i) constructing a causal fault graph from device logs, (ii) identifying faults while managing certainties and uncertainties using Markov blankets and the free-energy principle, and (iii) autonomously healing issues through active inference. Through continuous monitoring and adaptive reconfiguration, the agent maintains service continuity and stability under diverse failure conditions. Theoretical validations confirm the reliability and effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

This paper presents FPGA-accelerated RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) extensions for efficient neural network inference on resource-constrained edge devices. We introduce a custom RISC-V core with four novel ISA extensions (FPGA.VCONV, FPGA.GEMM, FPGA.RELU, FPGA.CUSTOM) and integrated neural network accelerators, implemented and validated on the Xilinx PYNQ-Z2 platform. The complete system achieves 2.14x average latency speedup and 49.1% energy reduction versus an ARM Cortex-A9 software baseline across four benchmark models (MobileNet V2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet Lite, YOLO Tiny). Hardware implementation closes timing with +12.793 ns worst negative slack at 50 MHz while using 0.43% LUTs and 11.4% BRAM for the base core and 38.8% DSPs when accelerators are active. Hardware verification confirms successful FPGA deployment with verified 64 KB BRAM memory interface and AXI interconnect functionality. All performance metrics are obtained from physical hardware measurements. This work establishes a reproducible framework for ISA-guided FPGA acceleration that complements fixed-function ASICs by trading peak performance for programmability."}

LLMServingSim2.0 addresses two key limitations of its predecessor: (1) integrating hardware models into system-level simulators is non-trivial due to the lack of a clear abstraction, and (2) existing simulators support only a narrow subset of serving techniques, leaving no infrastructure that captures the breadth of approaches in modern LLM serving. To overcome these issues, LLMServingSim2.0 adopts trace-driven performance modeling, accompanied by an operator-level latency profiler, enabling the integration of new accelerators with a single command. It further embeds up-to-date serving techniques while exposing flexible interfaces for request routing, cache management, and scheduling policies. In a TPU case study, our profiler requires 18.5x fewer LoC and outperforms the predecessor's hardware-simulator integration, demonstrating LLMServingSim2.0's low-effort hardware extensibility. Our experiments further show that LLMServingSim2.0 reproduces GPU-based LLM serving with 1.9% error, while maintaining practical simulation time, making it a comprehensive platform for both hardware developers and LLM service providers."}

Doing so delivers superior concurrent performance by freeing up all GPU cores for computation and also lowers interference in the memory sub-system (caches). While DMA collectives show strong promise, prior works have only studied them in limited context (bandwidth-bound transfer sizes only, performance-only).\n  To address this, we provide a comprehensive performance, power/energy and synchronization costs analysis of offloading ML communication collectives (all-gather, all-to-all) to DMA engines on state-of-the-art AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs. Our analysis reveals that, compared to the state-of-the-art RCCL communication collectives library, DMA collectives are at-par or better for large sizes (10s of MB to GB) in terms of both performance (16% better) and power (32% better). However, they significantly lag for latency-bound small sizes; 4.5X and 2.5X slower for all-gather and all-to-all, respectively. We provide a detailed latency breakdown of a DMA transfer and identify that DMA command scheduling and synchronization costs can limit DMA collective performance. To tackle this, we harness existing DMA architecture innovations, hitherto untapped, to build optimized DMA collectives and demonstrate their efficacy on real hardware. Our optimized implementations considerably close the performance gap for DMA collectives at smaller sizes (30% slower and 20% faster all-gather and all-to-all, respectively) and further improves performance (by 7%) and power savings at larger sizes (3-10%). Overall, this work represents a significant step toward making DMA collectives suitable for adoption in mainstream collective libraries."}

Analyzing comparative research for application-specific guidance", "comment": "7 pages", "summary": "The growing complexity of computational workloads has amplified the need for efficient and specialized hardware accelerators. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as prominent solutions, each excelling in specific domains. Although there is substantial research comparing FPGAs and GPUs, most of the work focuses primarily on performance metrics, offering limited insight into the specific types of applications that each accelerator benefits the most. This paper aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing insights from various research articles to guide users in selecting the appropriate accelerator for domain-specific applications. By categorizing the reviewed studies and analyzing key performance metrics, this work highlights the strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases for FPGAs and GPUs. The findings offer actionable recommendations, helping researchers and practitioners navigate trade-offs in performance, energy efficiency, and programmability."}

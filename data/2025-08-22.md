### [1] [Homomorphism Calculus for User-Defined Aggregations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15109)
*Ziteng Wang,Ruijie Fang,Linus Zheng,Dixin Tang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的同态运算微积分法，用于验证和反驳用户定义聚合函数（UDAF）是否满足同态性质，以支持高效的并行执行和增量计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Spark和Flink等框架支持UDAF，但要实现高效执行需要函数满足同态性质。这个问题鼗动了对自动化验证和构造合并运算符的需求。

Method: 论文提出了一种新的同态运算微积分法，可以验证和反驳UDAF是否为数据框同态映射。如果满足条件，还能构造相应的合并运算符。

Result: 实现了基于该微积分法的算法，并在真实世界的UDAF上进行了评估，表明该方法显著地超过了两个领先的综合器。

Conclusion: 该同态运算微积分法为UDAF的自动化验证和优化提供了有效解决方案，能够支持更高效的分布式数据处理。

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

### [2] [Software Model Checking via Summary-Guided Search (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15137)
*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPS是一种新的软件模型检测算法，结合了静态分析和测试生成，通过两层搜索策略高效发现程序错误，在基准测试中优于现有最先进工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的软件模型检测工具在处理具有长输入依赖错误路径的程序时效率不高，需要一种能够同时保证安全性和发现错误的新方法。

Method: GPS采用组合式、基于摘要的静态分析来指导程序状态的有向搜索，使用静态分析摘要剪除不可行路径并驱动测试生成，引入插装技术实现反驳完备性。

Result: GPS在包括SV-COMP在内的基准测试中表现优异，在解决的基准数量和运行时间上都超越了现有最先进的软件模型检测器。

Conclusion: GPS通过结合静态分析和测试生成的新颖方法，有效提高了软件模型检测的效率和能力，特别是在处理复杂错误路径方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [3] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为big-stop语义的扩展方法，通过归纳定义来捕获发散计算，弥补了传统大步语义无法处理程序发散的缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大步语义虽然简洁易用，但无法描述程序发散行为，而小步语义虽然功能强大但过于繁琐。需要找到既能保持大步语义的简洁性，又能处理发散计算的解决方案。

Method: 扩展标准大步语义推理规则，添加少量额外规则来定义等价于小步语义自反传递闭包的评估判断，无需引入错误状态或复杂的共归纳原理。

Result: 成功为类型化、非类型化和带效应的PCF语言以及基于while循环的命令式语言实现了big-stop语义，能够准确捕获发散计算。

Conclusion: big-stop语义在保持大步语义简洁性的同时，获得了与小步语义相当的表达能力，是处理程序发散行为的优雅解决方案。

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

### [4] [Probabilistic Inference for Datalog with Correlated Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15166)
*Jingbo Wang,Shashin Halalingaiah,Weiyi Chen,Chao Wang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Praline是Datalog的新扩展，用于处理输入事实间统计相关性的精确概率推理，通过约束优化和δ-精确推理算法提供可扩展的紧致概率边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率逻辑编程语言（如ProbLog）在进行概率推理时未考虑输入事实间的统计相关性，这可能导致推理结果不准确。

Method: 将推理任务表述为约束优化问题，提出δ-精确推理算法，结合约束求解、静态分析和迭代优化来提高可扩展性。

Result: 在包括侧信道分析在内的现实基准测试中，该方法不仅具有良好可扩展性，还能提供紧致的概率边界。

Conclusion: Praline系统能够有效处理输入相关性，在保持推理精确性的同时实现大规模程序的概率推理。

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

### [5] [Exploring the Theory and Practice of Concurrency in the Entity-Component-System Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15264)
*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,José Manuel Calderón Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为Core ECS的形式化模型，用于抽象ECS模式的核心本质，并识别出一类无论调度如何都能确定性执行的ECS程序，为确定性并发编程提供了新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECS模式虽然在游戏开发中广泛应用，但在其他领域认知度不高，现有解释往往局限于具体框架细节或不完美的比喻。需要一种严谨的形式化模型来揭示ECS模式的本质。

Method: 设计Core ECS形式化模型，抽象具体实现细节，识别确定性行为的ECS程序类别，并调研现实世界ECS框架的确定性并发机会。

Result: 发现所有调研的现实世界ECS框架都未能充分利用确定性并发的机会，存在改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究指出了新的ECS实现技术方向，可以更好地利用确定性并发机会，为构建确定性并发编程模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

### [6] [Fair Termination for Resource-Aware Active Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15333)
*Francesco Dagnino,Paola Giannini,Violet Ka I Pun,Ulises Torrella*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 开发了一个资源感知的主动对象核心演算和类型系统，确保良好类型化的程序能够公平终止


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动对象系统是分布式计算模型，用于建模分布式系统和业务流程工作流，需要资源感知的形式化方法

Method: 结合分级语义和类型系统技术（适用于顺序程序）与公平终止技术（适用于同步会话）

Result: 提出了一个核心演算和类型系统，确保良好类型化的程序能够公平终止

Conclusion: 成功将顺序程序的分级语义技术与同步会话的公平终止技术相结合，为资源感知主动对象模型提供了形式化基础

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

### [7] [Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576)
*Andreas Lööw,Seung Hoon Park,Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho,Sacha-Élie Ayoun,Opale Sjöstedt,Philippa Gardner*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文为内存模型参数化组合符号执行平台提供了新的形式化基础，支持分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析，并在Rocq定理证明器中实现和验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组合符号执行工具虽然利用了分离逻辑进行组合验证和错误分离逻辑进行组合错误查找，但缺乏内存模型参数化平台的形式化基础，限制了灵活性和适用范围。

Method: 基于Gillian平台，在Rocq交互式定理证明器中机械化形式化基础，支持多种内存模型（包括C和CHERI），涵盖分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析，并基于标准定义确保与其他工具的互操作性。

Result: 成功建立了内存模型参数化组合符号执行平台的形式化基础，支持多种内存模型和分析类型，并通过定理证明器验证了正确性。

Conclusion: 该工作为内存模型参数化组合符号执行平台提供了全面的形式化基础，增强了灵活性、适用范围和与其他工具的互操作性，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [8] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的主动学习技术SmartLabel，通过约束一致性评估(CCE)来处理神经符号程序合成中的神经网络误预测问题，显著提高了合成准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习技术在神经符号程序合成中由于神经网络误预测会导致返回错误程序，需要新的方法来处理这一独特挑战

Method: 基于约束一致性评估(CCE)的新策略，考虑神经误预测和用户反馈，迭代地提高CCE精度直到所有剩余程序保证观测等价

Result: 在三个神经符号领域实验中，SmartLabel为98%的基准测试识别出真实程序，平均需要不到5轮用户交互，而先前技术最多只能收敛到65%

Conclusion: SmartLabel方法有效解决了神经符号程序合成中的主动学习挑战，显著提升了合成准确性和用户交互效率

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种声明式数据管道架构，通过模块化框架在Apache Spark中集成机器学习能力，显著提升了开发效率、协作效率和系统性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式数据处理系统在平衡性能与代码可维护性、开发效率方面的挑战，特别是在大规模协作环境中团队间通信开销和跨组开发协调的复杂性

Method: 采用声明式数据管道架构，引入模块化框架，通过逻辑计算单元（Pipes）在Apache Spark中集成机器学习能力，建立清晰的组件边界和标准化接口

Result: 企业案例显示开发效率提升50%，协作/故障排除从数周压缩到数天，可扩展性提升500倍，吞吐量提升10倍；学术实验显示吞吐量至少快5.7倍，CPU利用率达99%

Conclusion: 该架构通过清晰的架构决策、实现策略和性能优化，为构建可扩展、可维护的数据处理系统提供了有效方案，成功平衡了系统性能与开发速度

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

### [10] [Databelt: A Continuous Data Path for Serverless Workflows in the 3D Compute Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15351)
*Cynthia Marcelino,Leonard Guelmino,Thomas Pusztai,Stefan Nastic*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt是一个面向3D计算连续体动态环境的无服务器工作流状态管理框架，通过SLO感知状态传播和函数状态融合机制，显著降低状态访问延迟和网络开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D计算连续体（边缘-云-空间）动态环境中，无服务器函数依赖远程存储服务导致高延迟和网络通信开销，特别是卫星移动导致网络拓扑频繁变化时，函数需要多跳访问云服务

Method: 1. SLO感知状态传播机制：主动将函数状态卸载到最合适的节点，使数据在执行节点或附近就位；2. 函数状态融合机制：为共享同一运行时的函数抽象状态管理，批量检索状态

Result: 实验结果显示：工作流执行时间减少高达66%，吞吐量提高50%；状态融合机制使存储操作延迟降低20%，减少了重复存储请求

Conclusion: Databelt框架有效解决了动态3D计算连续体环境中无服务器工作流的状态管理挑战，通过智能状态传播和融合显著提升了性能和效率

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

### [11] [Universal Dancing by Luminous Robots under Sequential Schedulers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15484)
*Caterina Feletti,Paola Flocchini,Debasish Pattanayak,Giuseppe Prencipe,Nicola Santoro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文证明了在LUMI模型和顺序调度器下，无需传统约束即可解决通用舞蹈问题，即机器人群体可以从任意初始配置执行任意模式序列


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明舞蹈问题需要严格的约束条件（如模式重复性、周期性、对称性等），限制了实际应用。本文旨在探索在LUMI模型下如何突破这些限制

Method: 利用LUMI模型中机器人带有有限颜色集的光源，在顺序调度器下实现分布式计数器机制，确保空间同质性

Result: 证明了在LUMI模型下，通用舞蹈问题（任意模式序列）可解，但可行舞蹈长度受颜色数量限制。提供了解决算法

Conclusion: LUMI模型配合顺序调度器能够突破传统舞蹈问题的约束限制，实现更通用的群体机器人舞蹈编排

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

### [12] [Lower Bounds for $k$-Set Agreement in Fault-Prone Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15562)
*Pierre Fraigniaud,Minh Hang Nguyen,Ami Paz,Ulrich Schmid,Hugo Rincon Galeana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了同步消息传递系统中k-set agreement问题的新下界，推广了先前在完全网络和任意无向网络中的结果，并提供了基于拓扑证明的简化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的k-set agreement下界主要针对完全网络或特定网络拓扑，缺乏对任意有向通信网络的通用下界分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供更一般化的理论结果。

Method: 采用拓扑证明方法，基于一系列可壳化的载波映射，从可壳化输入复形出发分析协议复形的演化。在前t/k轮使用每轮恰好崩溃k个进程的载波映射，之后采用新颖的保持高连通性的载波映射，并结合Sperner引理风格的论证。

Result: 成功推导出任意有向通信网络中k-set agreement的新下界，推广了先前在完全网络和无向网络中的结果，并提供了基于通信图半径的额外协议开销表达式。

Conclusion: 该研究为分布式系统中k-set agreement问题提供了更一般化的理论框架，证明了即使在任意网络拓扑下，k-set agreement仍然存在固有的计算限制，且可通过更小的输入复形进行简化分析。

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Conclusion: 该方法在各种硬件配置上均能实现一致的性能提升，并已集成到开源的TurboMind推理引擎中，为大语言模型的高效推理提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a
high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is
open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

Motivation: 在服务器无状态环境中，工作流中的函数可能被调度到具有不同缓存的不同节点，这会导致非直观的异常。现有缓存方案无法有效处理客户端漫游场景。

Method: 提出了CausalMesh协议，支持客户端在多服务器间漫游时的因果一致性缓存，包括无协调无中止的读写操作、读事务，以及支持读写事务性因果一致性（但牺牲中止自由）。

Result: 使用Dafny对协议进行了形式化验证，实验评估显示CausalMesh比现有方案具有更低的延迟和更高的吞吐量。

Conclusion: CausalMesh是第一个支持客户端漫游环境下无协调无中止操作和读事务的缓存系统，在服务器无状态计算环境中提供了有效的因果一致性缓存解决方案。

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with
Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional
real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based
preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level
Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture
performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data,
minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel
operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing
dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale
acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for
latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

Although this problem can be addressed by applying LLMs\nto formal rewrite systems, current LLMs are still far from adequate to generate\nsound rewrite chains. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes LLM-guided\nequality saturation, dubbed LGuess, by incorporating e-graphs as an\nintermediate layer between LLMs and rewrite systems. LGuess queries LLMs only\nfor high-level rewrite checkpoints and uses e-graphs to supply low-level\nrewrite chains between these checkpoints. The key technical challenge in this\nprocedure lies in effectively extracting a suitable checkpoint from a saturated\ne-graph, which LGuess addresses by learning a probabilistic model from the LLM.\nThe model predicts probable checkpoints while remaining simple enough for\neffective extraction. We implement a prototype of LGuess and evaluate it on the\nproblem of factorizing multivariable polynomials. The results demonstrate a\nsignificant advantage of LGuess compared to both straightforward equality\nsaturation and the approach that queries the LLM directly for the rewrite\nchain."}

In this paper,\nwe begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key\nchallenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between\ngeneration and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources,\nand (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these\nchallenges, we propose \\texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of\n\\texttt{Mutator}, \\texttt{Executor}, and \\texttt{Inspector}.

The traditional\nalgorithm has the bottleneck of slow convergence and easy to fall into local\noptimization, while the heuristic methods such as genetic algorithm are limited\nby the CPU serial calculation and inefficient. In order to solve the above\nchallenges, this paper proposes the fusion scheme of hwsda hybrid optimization\nalgorithm and GPU parallel acceleration technology: the differential evolution\nalgorithm (DE) is used to realize the global search, and the gray wolf\noptimization algorithm (GWO) is used to strengthen the local search and\nconvergence speed, and the two coordinate to balance the global and local\noptimization requirements; At the same time, it relies on GPU multi-core\narchitecture to realize thread level parallel computing and improve\noptimization efficiency. This scheme effectively breaks through the\noptimization problem of high-dimensional discrete space, improves the accuracy\nof crystal domain control, improves the efficiency of quasi phase matching\ndesign by hundreds to thousands of times compared with traditional CPU serial\ncomputing, provides a new paradigm for the design of complex nonlinear optical\ndevices, and helps promote the performance breakthrough and industrial\napplication of related devices in the fields of quantum optics and laser\nprocessing."}

Conventional pilot aided estimators incur substantial\noverhead, while deep learning approaches degrade under dynamic pilot patterns\nand time varying fading. This paper presents a pilot-aided Flash-Attention\nTransformer framework that unifies model-driven pilot acquisition with data\ndriven CSI reconstruction through patch-wise self-attention and a physics aware\ncomposite loss function enforcing phase alignment, correlation consistency, and\ntime frequency smoothness. Under a standardized 3GPP NR configuration, the\nproposed framework outperforms LMMSE and LSTM baselines by approximately 13 dB\nin phase invariant normalized mean-square error (NMSE) with markedly lower\nbit-error rate (BER), while reducing pilot overhead by 16 times. These results\ndemonstrate that attention based architectures enable reliable CSI recovery and\nenhanced spectral efficiency without compromising link quality, addressing a\nfundamental bottleneck in adaptive, low-overhead channel estimation for\nnon-stationary 5G and beyond-5G networks."}

By requiring only stability of\nmeasurement and frequency errors, we can circumvent existing lower bounds,\nleading to dramatic improvements under very general conditions. For example, if\nlinks exhibit a uniform worst-case estimation error of $\\Delta$ and a change in\nestimation errors of $\\delta\\ll \\Delta$ on relevant time scales, we bound the\nlocal skew by $O(\\Delta+\\delta \\log D)$ for networks of diameter $D$,\neffectively ``breaking'' the established $\\Omega(\\Delta\\log D)$ lower bound,\nwhich holds when $\\delta=\\Delta$. Similarly, we show how to limit the influence\nof local oscillators on $\\delta$ to scale with the change of frequency of an\nindividual oscillator on relevant time scales, rather than a worst-case bound\nover all oscillators and the lifetime of the system.\n  Moreover, we show how to ensure self-stabilization in this challenging\nsetting. Last, but not least, we extend all of our results to the scenario of\nexternal synchronization, at the cost of a limited increase in stabilization\ntime."}

The integration domain is recursively partitioned into\nsubdomains whose refinement is guided by local error estimators. Each subdomain\nevolves independently on a GPU, which exposes a significant load imbalance as\nthe adaptive process progresses. To address this challenge, we introduce a\ndecentralised load redistribution schemes based on a cyclic round-robin policy.\nThis strategy dynamically rebalance subdomains across devices through\nnon-blocking, CUDA-aware MPI communication that overlaps with computation. The\nproposed strategy has two main advantages compared to a state-of-the-art\nGPU-tailored package: higher efficiency in high dimensions; and improved\nrobustness w.r.t the integrand regularity and the target accuracy."}

LARK introduces Partition Availability\nConditions (PAC) that reason over the entire database cluster rather than fixed\nreplica sets, improving partition availability under independent failures by\nroughly 3x when tolerating one failure and 10x when tolerating two. Unlike\nRaft, Paxos, and Viewstamped Replication, LARK eliminates ordered logs,\nenabling immediate partition readiness after leader changes -- with at most a\nper-key duplicate-resolution round trip when the new leader lacks the latest\ncopy. Under equal storage budgets -- where both systems maintain only f+1 data\ncopies to tolerate f failures -- LARK continues committing through data-node\nfailures while log-based protocols must pause commits for replica rebuilding.\nThese properties also enable zero-downtime rolling restarts even when\nmaintaining only two copies. We provide formal safety arguments and a TLA+\nspecification, and we demonstrate through analysis and experiments that LARK\nachieves significant availability gains."}

This paper investigates a novel approach\nto code optimization where Large Language Models (LLMs) guide the process\nthrough a closed-loop interaction with a compiler. We present ComPilot, an\nexperimental framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs, without any\ntask-specific fine-tuning, as interactive optimization agents. ComPilot\nestablishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given\nloop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting\nback legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this\nconcrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our\nextensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the\neffectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean\nspeedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original\ncode. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the\nstate-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases.\nThis experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively\nguide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening\npromising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization."}

However, current MPQC pipelines rely on expensive online compilation to co-optimize concurrently running programs, because quantum executables are device-dependent, non-portable across qubit regions, and highly susceptible to noise and crosstalk. This online step dominates runtime and impedes low-latency deployments for practical, real-world workloads in the future, such as repeatedly invoked Quantum Neural Network (QNN) services.\n  We present FLAMENCO, a fidelity-aware multi-version compilation system that enables independent offline compilation and low-latency, high-fidelity multiprogramming at runtime. At the architecture level, FLAMENCO abstracts devices into compute units to drastically shrink the search space of region allocation. At compile time, it generates diverse executable versions for each program -- each bound to a distinct qubit region -- allowing dynamic region selection at runtime and overcoming non-portability. At runtime, FLAMENCO employs a streamlined orchestrator that leverages post-compilation fidelity metrics to avoid conflicts and mitigate crosstalk, achieving reliable co-execution without online co-optimization. Comprehensive evaluations against state-of-the-art MPQC baselines show that FLAMENCO removes online compilation overhead, achieves over 5$\\times$ runtime speedup, improves execution fidelity, and maintains high utilization as concurrency increases."}

However, heterogeneous resources, dynamic workloads, and diverse security requirements make optimal service placement highly challenging. Most solutions focus primarily on performance metrics while overlooking the security implications of deployment decisions. This paper proposes a Security and Performance-Aware Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (SPA-DDRL) framework for joint optimization of service response time and security compliance in Fog computing. The problem is formulated as a weighted multi-objective optimization task, minimizing latency while maximizing a security score derived from the security capabilities of Fog nodes. The security score features a new three-tier hierarchy, where configuration-level checks verify proper settings, capability-level assessments evaluate the resource security features, and control-level evaluations enforce stringent policies, thereby ensuring compliant solutions that align with performance objectives. SPA-DDRL adopts a distributed broker-learner architecture where multiple brokers perform autonomous service-placement decisions and a centralized learner coordinates global policy optimization through shared prioritized experiences. It integrates three key improvements, including Long Short-Term Memory networks, Prioritized Experience Replay, and off-policy correction mechanisms to improve the agent's performance. Experiments based on real IoT workloads show that SPA-DDRL significantly improves both service response time and placement security compared to current approaches, achieving a 16.3% improvement in response time and a 33% faster convergence rate. It also maintains consistent, feasible, security-compliant solutions across all system scales, while baseline techniques fail or show performance degradation."}

A Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation in Functional Programming", "comment": null, "summary": "Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues."}

Disaggregating the generation and training stages in RL into a parallel, asynchronous pipeline offers the potential for flexible scaling and improved throughput. However, it still faces two critical challenges. First, the generation stage often becomes a bottleneck due to dynamic workload shifts and severe execution imbalances. Second, the decoupled stages result in diverse and dynamic network traffic patterns that overwhelm conventional network fabrics. This paper introduces OrchestrRL, an orchestration framework that dynamically manages compute and network rhythms in disaggregated RL. To improve generation efficiency, OrchestrRL employs an adaptive compute scheduler that dynamically adjusts parallelism to match workload characteristics within and across generation steps. This accelerates execution while continuously rebalancing requests to mitigate stragglers. To address the dynamic network demands inherent in disaggregated RL -- further intensified by parallelism switching -- we co-design RFabric, a reconfigurable hybrid optical-electrical fabric. RFabric leverages optical circuit switches at selected network tiers to reconfigure the topology in real time, enabling workload-aware circuits for (i) layer-wise collective communication during training iterations, (ii) generation under different parallelism configurations, and (iii) periodic inter-cluster weight synchronization. We evaluate OrchestrRL on a physical testbed with 48 H800 GPUs, demonstrating up to a 1.40x throughput improvement. Furthermore, we develop RLSim, a high-fidelity simulator, to evaluate RFabric at scale. Our results show that RFabric achieves superior performance-cost efficiency compared to static Fat-Tree networks, establishing it as a highly effective solution for large-scale RL workloads."}

Existing systems exhibit poor failure resilience: even a single worker failure triggers a coarse-grained, service-wide restart, discarding accumulated progress and halting the entire inference pipeline during recovery--an approach clearly ill-suited for latency-sensitive, LLM services.\n  We present Tarragon, a resilient MoE inference framework that confines the failures impact to individual workers while allowing the rest of the pipeline to continue making forward progress. Tarragon exploits the natural separation between the attention and expert computation in MoE-based transformers, treating attention workers (AWs) and expert workers (EWs) as distinct failure domains. Tarragon introduces a reconfigurable datapath to mask failures by rerouting requests to healthy workers. On top of this datapath, Tarragon implements a self-healing mechanism that relaxes the tightly synchronized execution of existing MoE frameworks. For stateful AWs, Tarragon performs asynchronous, incremental KV cache checkpointing with per-request restoration, and for stateless EWs, it leverages residual GPU memory to deploy shadow experts. These together keep recovery cost and recomputation overhead extremely low. Our evaluation shows that, compared to state-of-the-art MegaScale-Infer, Tarragon reduces failure-induced stalls by 160-213x (from ~64 s down to 0.3-0.4 s) while preserving performance when no failures occur."}

Preserving both spatial and frequency representations of data is crucial for applications such as cosmology, turbulent combustion, and X-ray diffraction, where spatial and frequency views provide complementary scientific insights. In particular, many analysis tasks rely on frequency-domain representations to capture key features, including the power spectrum of cosmology simulations, the turbulent energy spectrum in combustion, and diffraction patterns in reciprocal space for ptychography. However, existing compression methods guarantee accuracy only in the spatial domain while disregarding the frequency domain. To address this limitation, we propose an algorithm that corrects the errors produced by off-the-shelf ``base'' compressors such as SZ3, ZFP, and SPERR, thereby preserving both spatial and frequency representations by bounding errors in both domains. By expressing frequency-domain errors as linear combinations of spatial-domain errors, we derive a region that jointly bounds errors in both domains. Given as input the spatial errors from a base compressor and user-defined error bounds in the spatial and frequency domains, we iteratively project the spatial error vector onto the regions defined by the spatial and frequency constraints until it lies within their intersection. We further accelerate the algorithm using GPU parallelism to achieve practical performance. We validate our approach with datasets from cosmology simulations, X-ray diffraction, combustion simulation, and electroencephalography demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving critical scientific information in both spatial and frequency domains."}

Generative recommendation (GR) models can improve quality by consuming long user-behavior sequences, but in production their online sequence length is tightly capped by the ranking-stage P99 budget. We observe that the majority of GR tokens encode user behaviors that are independent of the item candidates, suggesting an opportunity to pre-infer a user-behavior prefix once and reuse it during ranking rather than recomputing it on the critical path. Realizing this idea at industrial scale is non-trivial: the prefix cache must survive across multiple pipeline stages before the final ranking instance is determined, the user population implies cache footprints far beyond a single device, and indiscriminate pre-inference would overload shared resources under high QPS. We present RelayGR, a production system that enables in-HBM relay-race inference for GR. RelayGR selectively pre-infers long-term user prefixes, keeps their KV caches resident in HBM over the request lifecycle, and ensures the subsequent ranking can consume them without remote fetches. RelayGR combines three techniques: 1) a sequence-aware trigger that admits only at-risk requests under a bounded cache footprint and pre-inference load, 2) an affinity-aware router that co-locates cache production and consumption by routing both the auxiliary pre-infer signal and the ranking request to the same instance, and 3) a memory-aware expander that uses server-local DRAM to capture short-term cross-request reuse while avoiding redundant reloads. We implement RelayGR on Huawei Ascend NPUs and evaluate it with real queries. Under a fixed P99 SLO, RelayGR supports up to 1.5$\\times$ longer sequences and improves SLO-compliant throughput by up to 3.6$\\times$."}

Such distortions may compromise downstream analyses and lead to incorrect scientific conclusions in applications such as combustion and cosmology. This paper presents a distributed and parallel algorithm for correcting topological features, specifically, piecewise linear Morse Smale segmentations (PLMSS), which decompose the domain into monotone regions labeled by their corresponding local minima and maxima. While a single GPU algorithm (MSz) exists for PLMSS correction after compression, no methodology has been developed that scales beyond a single GPU for extreme scale data. We identify the key bottleneck in scaling PLMSS correction as the parallel computation of integral paths, a communication-intensive computation that is notoriously difficult to scale. Instead of explicitly computing and correcting integral paths, our algorithm simplifies MSz by preserving steepest ascending and descending directions across all locations, thereby minimizing interprocess communication while introducing negligible additional storage overhead. With this simplified algorithm and relaxed synchronization, our method achieves over 90% parallel efficiency on 128 GPUs on the Perlmutter supercomputer for real world datasets."}

We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices."}

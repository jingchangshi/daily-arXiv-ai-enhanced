Federated Graph Neural Networks\n(FGNNs) can perform QoS data prediction as well as maintaining user privacy.\nHowever, existing FGNN-based QoS predictors commonly implement on-device\ntraining on scattered explicit user-service graphs, thereby failing to utilize\nthe implicit user-user interactions. To address this issue, this study proposes\na high order collaboration-oriented federated graph neural network (HC-FGNN) to\nobtain accurate QoS prediction with privacy preservation. Concretely, it\nmagnifies the explicit user-service graphs following the principle of attention\nmechanism to obtain the high order collaboration, which reflects the implicit\nuser-user interactions. Moreover, it utilizes a lightweight-based message\naggregation way to improve the computational efficiency. The extensive\nexperiments on two QoS datasets from real application indicate that the\nproposed HC-FGNN possesses the advantages of high prediction accurate and\nprivacy protection."}

Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a promising technique to\nachieve efficient utilization of communication resource for model aggregation\nby leveraging the superposition property of a wireless multiple access channel\n(MAC). However, AirComp requires strict synchronization among edge devices,\nwhich is hard to achieve in heterogeneous scenarios. In this paper, we propose\nan AirComp-based grouping asynchronous federated learning mechanism\n(Air-FedGA), which combines the advantages of AirComp and asynchronous FL to\naddress the communication and heterogeneity challenges. Specifically, Air-FedGA\norganizes workers into groups and performs over-the-air aggregation within each\ngroup, while groups asynchronously communicate with the parameter server to\nupdate the global model. In this way, Air-FedGA accelerates the FL model\ntraining by over-the-air aggregation, while relaxing the synchronization\nrequirement of this aggregation technology. We theoretically prove the\nconvergence of Air-FedGA. We formulate a training time minimization problem for\nAir-FedGA and propose the power control and worker grouping algorithm to solve\nit, which jointly optimizes the power scaling factors at edge devices, the\ndenoising factors at the parameter server, as well as the worker grouping\nstrategy. We conduct experiments on classical models and datasets, and the\nresults demonstrate that our proposed mechanism and algorithm can speed up FL\nmodel training by 29.9%-71.6% compared with the state-of-the-art solutions."}

To accurately model complex interactions, such as detailed\nbiomolecular interactions, scientists often rely on multiscale models comprised\nof several internal models operating at difference scales, ranging from\nmicroscopic to macroscopic length and time scales. Bridging the gap between\ndifferent time and length scales has historically been challenging but the\nadvent of newer machine learning (ML) approaches has shown promise for tackling\nthat task.

However, current\nsystems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,\nwhich fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches\nshortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial\nrecomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV\ncache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the\nagent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a\nsteps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future\nactivation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node\nlevel, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently\nmanage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a\nfully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required\ntensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next\nstep, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation.

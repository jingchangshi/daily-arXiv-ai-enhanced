If so, it will enable rapid\nprototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this\nquestion using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via\nsmall-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational\nsemantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written,\nLLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by\ncode-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes.\nGiven a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are\nevaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state\nprediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction.\nTo distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two\nnonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard\nrules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard\nsemantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that\n(i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models\nperform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about\nhighly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and\nsurprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but\noften hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs\ncould serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of\ntheir robust semantics understanding.

Then, we use one of the\nexamples to introduce multiple ways to infuse heuristic knowledge and reduce\nsolving time. stableKanren is an extension of miniKanren that supports normal\nlogic programs under stable model semantics. stableKanren further supports\nnumeric computation by constructing a constraint store for integrity\nconstraints. There are three ways to extend a relational programming language\nwith numeric computations: relational number representation, grounding numbers\nto symbols, and constraint store construction. We demonstrate that the numeric\ncomputations in stableKanren have a straightforward numerical representation\ncompared to relational number representations. More importantly, stableKanren\nbalances symbolic and numeric computation in relational programming by avoiding\nthe grounding of all numbers to symbols. Lastly, it also has simpler syntax\ncompared to other constraint store construction approaches. stableKanren\nsupports combinatorial search problem solving under a declarative generate and\ntest paradigm. Such a paradigm generates all possible combinations of solutions\nto the problem, then applies a set of constraints to prune out the unwanted\nsolutions. We demonstrate that different approaches to writing programs or\nqueries affect the solver's performance in the SEND+MORE=MONEY puzzle. The\nperformance gradually improves as more heuristic knowledge is infused through\nthe programs or queries. Additionally, we show how to use an external function\nto achieve a hybrid solution."}

In contrast, a\nprocessor's implementation often significantly influences performance, power\nefficiency, and area usage. Therefore, a major goal of instruction set design\nshould be maximizing instruction density and encoding efficiency. This paper\nintroduces the design elements of the Scry instruction set architecture that\nmost significantly affect instruction density and encoding efficiency. Scry is\na novel and experimental instruction set that revisits first principles to\ndesign an instruction set fit for modern processor implementations. Scry uses\nforward-temporal referencing as a means of data flow, where instructions refer\nto which future instructions consume their outputs. It also uses internal\ntagging, where the processors track data types internally, to reduce the number\nof instructions needed and increase flexibility. Combining these two methods,\nScry achieves instruction-feature parity with RISC-V's RV64IMC using only\n2-byte instructions compared to RISC-V's 4 bytes.

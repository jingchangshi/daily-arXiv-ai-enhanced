In the \\emph{Black Hole Search\n(BHS)} problem, a team of agents operates on a graph $G$ with the objective\nthat at least one agent must survive and correctly identify an edge incident to\nthe black hole. Prior work has addressed BHS in arbitrary dynamic graphs under\nthe restrictive \\emph{face-to-face} communication, where agents can exchange\ninformation only when co-located. This constraint significantly increases the\nnumber of agents required to solve the problem. In this work, we strengthen the\ncapabilities of agents in two ways: (i) granting them \\emph{global\ncommunication}, enabling interaction regardless of location, and (ii) equipping\nthem with \\emph{1-hop visibility}, allowing each agent to observe its immediate\nneighborhood. These enhancements lead to more efficient solutions for the BHS\nproblem in dynamic graphs."}

The robots are autonomous, anonymous, oblivious and\nsilent, operating in the Euclidean plane under the conventional\n\\textit{Look-Compute-Move} cycle. A primary task in this model is the\n\\textit{separation problem}, where unconscious robots sharing the same color\nmust separate from others, forming recognizable geometric shapes such as\ncircles, points, or lines. All prior works model the robots as\n\\textit{transparent}, enabling each to know the positions and colors of all\nother robots. In contrast, we model the robots as \\textit{opaque}, where a\nrobot can obstruct the visibility of two other robots, if it lies on the line\nsegment between them. Under this obstructed visibility, we consider a variant\nof the separation problem in which robots, starting from any arbitrary initial\nconfiguration, are required to separate into concentric semicircles. We present\na collision-free algorithm that solves the separation problem under a\nsemi-synchronous scheduler in $O(n)$ epochs, where $n$ is the number of robots.\nThe robots agree on one coordinate axis but have no knowledge of $n$."}

To mitigate these challenges, researchers\nhave proposed optimizing and offloading partitions of DL models among user\ndevices, edge servers, and the cloud. In this setting, users can take advantage\nof different services to support their intelligent applications. For example,\nedge resources offer low response latency. In contrast, cloud platforms provide\nlow monetary cost computation resources for computation-intensive workloads.\nHowever, communication between DL model partitions can introduce transmission\nbottlenecks and pose risks of data leakage. Recent research aims to balance\naccuracy, computation delay, transmission delay, and privacy concerns. They\naddress these issues with model compression, model distillation, transmission\ncompression, and model architecture adaptations, including internal\nclassifiers. This survey contextualizes the state-of-the-art model offloading\nmethods and model adaptation techniques by studying their implication to a\nmulti-objective optimization comprising inference latency, data privacy, and\nresource monetary cost."}

In this paper, we investigate the problem of collaborative inference\nin wireless edge networks, where energy-constrained edge devices aim to\ncomplete inference tasks within given deadlines. These tasks are carried out\nusing neural networks, and the edge device seeks to optimize inference\nperformance under energy and delay constraints. The inference process can be\nsplit between the edge device and an edge server, thereby achieving\ncollaborative inference over wireless networks. We formulate an inference\nutility optimization problem subject to energy and delay constraints, and\npropose a novel solution called Bayes-Split-Edge, which leverages Bayesian\noptimization for collaborative split inference over wireless edge networks. Our\nsolution jointly optimizes the transmission power and the neural network split\npoint. The Bayes-Split-Edge framework incorporates a novel hybrid acquisition\nfunction that balances inference task utility, sample efficiency, and\nconstraint violation penalties. We evaluate our approach using the VGG19 model\non the ImageNet-Mini dataset, and Resnet101 on Tiny-ImageNet, and real-world\nmMobile wireless channel datasets. Numerical results demonstrate that\nBayes-Split-Edge achieves up to 2.4x reduction in evaluation cost compared to\nstandard Bayesian optimization and achieves near-linear convergence. It also\noutperforms several baselines, including CMA-ES, DIRECT, exhaustive search, and\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while matching exhaustive search\nperformance under tight constraints. These results confirm that the proposed\nframework provides a sample-efficient solution requiring maximum 20 function\nevaluations and constraint-aware optimization for wireless split inference in\nedge computing systems."}

We consider in\nparticular for $T$ the allocation monad, which we introduce to model and study\nresource-safety properties. We apply these results to a series of two linear\neffectful calculi for which we establish their resource-safety properties.\n  The first calculus is a linear call-by-push-value language with two\nallocation effects $\\mathit{new}$ and $\\mathit{delete}$. The resource-safety\nproperties follow from the linear (and even ordered) character of the typing\nrules.\n  We then explain how to integrate exceptions on top of linearity and effects\nby adjoining default destruction actions to types, as inspired by C++/Rust\ndestructors. We see destructors as objects $\\delta : A\\rightarrow TI$ in the\nslice category over $TI$. This construction gives rise to a second calculus, an\naffine ordered call-by-push-value language with exceptions and destructors, in\nwhich the weakening rule performs a side-effect.

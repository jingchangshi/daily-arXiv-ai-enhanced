*Michael Arntzenius*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该论文展示了通过有界工作实现公平性的思想不仅适用于miniKanren的搜索策略，也适用于实现最坏情况最优连接


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索miniKanren中通过有界工作实现公平性的思想在其他领域的应用潜力

Method: 使用可搜索迭代器接口实现最坏情况最优连接，采用有界工作的公平性策略

Result: 成功将miniKanren的公平性思想应用于数据库连接操作，实现了优雅的组合式实现方法

Conclusion: 有界工作的公平性策略是一个通用概念，可应用于不同领域实现高效且公平的计算

Abstract: miniKanren's key semantic advance over Prolog is to implement a complete yet
efficient search strategy, fairly interleaving execution between disjuncts.
This fairness is accomplished by bounding how much work is done exploring one
disjunct before switching to the next. We show that the same idea -- fairness
via bounded work -- underlies an elegant compositional approach to implementing
worst-case optimal joins using a seekable iterator interface, suitable for
shallow embedding in functional languages.

TL;DR: ExpertFlow是一个用于MoE推理的运行时系统，通过自适应专家预取和缓存感知路由，显著减少内存传输延迟，将模型停顿时间降低到基线的0.1%以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU内存容量有限，限制了大型语言模型的扩展。传统MoE推理方法存在频繁参数传输导致的延迟问题，且现有的跨层预测策略缺乏对不同硬件平台和工作负载的适应性。

Method: 结合自适应专家预取和缓存感知路由，利用运行时统计信息（传输带宽、参数维度、模型反馈信号）动态调整预测范围，采用混合跨层预测方案融合预门控信息和中间计算状态来预测未来专家需求。

Result: 评估显示ExpertFlow将模型停顿时间降低到基线的0.1%以下，有效减少了缓存未命中和专家交换导致的延迟。

Conclusion: ExpertFlow能够在严格的内存约束下优化MoE推理，通过自适应预取决策与实际使用行为的对齐，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

Result: 通过同构/异构小芯片和不同片上网络架构的广泛评估，证明了该框架的通用性，准确度提升高达340%，并具备功耗和热分析能力。

Conclusion: CHIPSIM为小芯片系统提供了一种快速准确的仿真方法，能够有效支持并行DNN执行的性能、功耗和热分析。

Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

Conclusion: MIREDO框架能够系统性地探索广阔的设计空间，为存内计算架构确定最优的数据流配置。

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

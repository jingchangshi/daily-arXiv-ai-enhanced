To address the low inference efficiency of LLMs across diverse heterogeneous platforms, this paper proposes a practical optimization method, Opt4GPTQ, designed for 4-bit GPTQ quantized LLMs inference on heterogeneous AI accelerators. Built upon the vLLM serving system, Opt4GPTQ integrates three platform-level optimization strategies: Shared Memory Buffering optimization (SMB-Opt), which caches data in shared memory and employs single-threaded writes; Vectorized Memory Loading optimization (VML-Opt), which utilizes vectorized memory operations for efficient data loading; and Inline Assembly optimization (ILAOpt), which directly leverages hardware-native vector halfprecision addition and fused multiply-accumulate instructions for efficient execution. Experimental results show that Opt4GPTQ effectively improves inference performance across different models, achieving up to 84.42% throughput improvement and up to 51.35% latency reduction. This work highlights the critical role of platform-level engineering optimizations in enabling efficient LLMs inference on emerging heterogeneous AI acceleration architectures and provides valuable deployment experience and methodologies for future heterogeneous platform adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Opt4GPTQ\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf94\u4f4dGPTQ\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784AI\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8evLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u4f18\u5316(SMB-Opt)\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u52a0\u8f7d\u4f18\u5316(VML-Opt)\u548c\u5185\u8054\u6c47\u7f16\u4f18\u5316(ILA-Opt)\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cOpt4GPTQ\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b084.42%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c51.35%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5f02\u6784AI\u52a0\u901f\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f02\u6784\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

Assuncao", "Kaiwen Zhang"], "title": "AI-driven Predictive Shard Allocation for Scalable Next Generation Blockchains", "comment": null, "summary": "Sharding has emerged as a key technique to address blockchain scalability by partitioning the ledger into multiple shards that process transactions in parallel. Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines.

In recent work, Yao et al. scaled semantic typing to the verification of timed message-passing protocols, which are prevalent in, e.g., IoT and real-time systems applications. The appeal of semantic typing in this context is precisely because of its ability to support typed and untyped program components alike -- including physical objects -- which caters to the heterogeneity of these applications. Another demand inherent to these applications is timing: constraining the time or time window within which a message exchange must happen. Yao et al. equipped their logical relation not only with temporal predicates, but also with computable trajectories, to supply the evidence that an inhabitant can step from one time point to another one. While Yao et al. provide the formalization for such a verification tool, it lacks a mechanization. Mechanizing the system would not only provide a machine proof for it, but also facilitate scalability for future extensions and applications.\n  This paper tackles the challenge of mechanizing the resulting proof-relevant logical relation in a proof assistant. allowing trajectories to be interleaved, partitioned, and concatenated, while the intended equality on trajectories is the equality of their graphs when seen as processes indexed by time. Unfortunately, proof assistants based on intensional type theory only have modest support for such equations, forcing a prolific use of transports. This paper reports on the process of mechanizing Yao et al.'s results, comprising the logical relation, the algebra of computable trajectories with supporting lemmas, and the fundamental theorem of the logical relation, in the Rocq theorem prover.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728Rocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Yao\u7b49\u4eba\u5173\u4e8e\u5b9a\u65f6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u534f\u8bae\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5316\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u65f6\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002Yao\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728Rocq\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u4e2d\u673a\u68b0\u5316Yao\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u76f8\u5173\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u3001\u5206\u533a\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u6db5\u7c7b\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee3\u6570\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5f15\u7406\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u57fa\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u68b0\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system.

Existing solutions like model compression often sacrifice accuracy, while specialized hardware remains costly and inflexible. Hybrid inference methods, however, typically overlook how operator characteristics impact performance. In this work, we present SparOA, a CPU-GPU hybrid inference framework, which leverages both sparsity and computational intensity to optimize operator scheduling. SparOA embraces aforementioned challenges through three key components: (1) a threshold predictor that accurately determines optimal sparsity and computational intensity thresholds; (2) a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that dynamically optimizes resource allocation based on real-time hardware states; and (3) a hybrid inference engine that enhances efficiency through asynchronous execution and batch size optimization.Extensive results show that SparOA achieves an average speedup of 1.22-1.31x compared to all baselines, and outperforms the CPU-Only by up to 50.7x.

Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "R3A\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684RTL\u7a0b\u5e8f\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RTL bug\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650bug\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548cRTL\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce2\u5f62\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faR3A\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u968f\u673a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a2\u7d22\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u6545\u969c\u5019\u9009\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u8d77\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728RTL-repair\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cR3A\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4fee\u590d\u4e8690.6%\u7684bug\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u8986\u76d645%\u7684bug\uff0c\u5e73\u5747pass@5\u7387\u8fbe\u523086.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "R3A\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u968f\u673a\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684RTL\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Thanks to a distributed optimization of subsystems, the production and consumption scheduling is achieved while maintaining flexibility and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u6b65\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u9645\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u524d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5404\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The Sun is by far the largest energy source in our solar system, and thus it warrants consideration how future AI infrastructure could most efficiently tap into that power. This work explores a scalable compute system for machine learning in space, using fleets of satellites equipped with solar arrays, inter-satellite links using free-space optics, and Google tensor processing unit (TPU) accelerator chips. To facilitate high-bandwidth, low-latency inter-satellite communication, the satellites would be flown in close proximity. We illustrate the basic approach to formation flight via a 81-satellite cluster of 1 km radius, and describe an approach for using high-precision ML-based models to control large-scale constellations. Trillium TPUs are radiation tested. They survive a total ionizing dose equivalent to a 5 year mission life without permanent failures, and are characterized for bit-flip errors.

In this work, we present a federated learning framework built to run efficiently across mixed HPC and cloud environments. Our system addresses key challenges such as system heterogeneity, communication overhead, and resource scheduling, while maintaining model accuracy and data privacy. Through experiments on a hybrid testbed, we demonstrate strong performance in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and convergence, even under non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data distributions and varied hardware. These results highlight the potential of federated learning as a practical approach to building scalable Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in modern, distributed computing settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u79fb\u52a8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4e91\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6df7\u5408HPC\u548c\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "nFlows\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aNUMA\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728NUMA\u67b6\u6784\u7684HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6267\u884c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u666e\u904d\u91c7\u7528NUMA\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2aNUMA\u57df\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u533a\u57df\uff08HBM\u548cDRAM\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u653e\u7f6e\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u521d\u662f\u4e3aGrid\u6216Cloud\u73af\u5883\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\uff0c\u5f88\u5c11\u8003\u8651NUMA\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6784\u5efa\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7814\u7a76NUMA\u5bf9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1NUMA\u611f\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u5185\u5b58\u5185\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86nFlows\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1NUMA\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "nFlows\u586b\u8865\u4e86NUMA\u611f\u77e5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728HPC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76NUMA\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this paper, we take image generation as a representative application and propose a batch denoising framework, followed by a joint optimization of content generation and transmission, with the objective of maximizing the average AIGC service quality under an end-to-end service delay constraint. Motivated by the empirical observations that (i) batch denoising effectively reduces per-step denoising delay by enhancing parallelism and (ii) early denoising steps have a greater impact on generation quality than later steps, we develop the STACKING algorithm to optimize batch denoising. The STACKING operates independently of any specific form of the content quality function and achieves lower computational complexity.

These agents, modelled as autonomous physical or software entities, possess local computation power, finite memory and have the ability to traverse a graph, offering efficient solutions to a range of classical problems. In this work, we focus on the problem of computing a \\emph{minimal dominating set} (mDS) in anonymous graphs using mobile agents. Building on the recently proposed optimal dispersion algorithm on the synchronous mobile agent model, we design two new algorithms that achieve a \\emph{linear-time} solution for this problem in the synchronous setting. Specifically, given a connected $n$-node graph with $n$ agents initially placed in either rooted or arbitrary configurations, we show that an mDS can be computed in $O(n)$ rounds using only $O(\\log n)$ bits of memory per agent, without using any prior knowledge of any global parameters. This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u533f\u540d\u56fe\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6(mDS)\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4ec5\u9700O(n)\u8f6e\u6b21\u548cO(log n)\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u662f\u56fe\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u5f85\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5728\u6839\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u5728\u4efb\u610f\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u56fe\u904d\u5386\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6811\u5e76\u9009\u4e3e\u552f\u4e00\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fde\u901an\u8282\u70b9\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\u662f\u6839\u914d\u7f6e\u8fd8\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u90fd\u80fd\u5728O(n)\u8f6e\u6b21\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4ec5\u9700O(log n)\u4f4d\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u6570\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u6811\u548c\u9009\u4e3e\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u6b65\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u9009\u4e3e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%.

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels.

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Beluga\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCXL\u6280\u672f\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u8ba9GPU\u548cCPU\u5171\u4eab\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4RDMA\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u5c1189.6%\u7684\u9996\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u53477.35\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u548c\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4f7f\u5f97\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u4e3aGPU\u52a0\u901f\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709RDMA\u5206\u89e3\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u590d\u6742\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u5f00\u9500\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBeluga\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301GPU\u548cCPU\u901a\u8fc7CXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u4ee5\u539f\u751fload/store\u8bed\u4e49\u8bbf\u95ee\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1Beluga-KVCache\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u95e8\u7ba1\u7406LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21KVCache\u3002", "result": "\u5728vLLM\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4RDMA\u65b9\u6848\uff0cBeluga-KVCache\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8689.6%\u7684\u9996\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u548c7.35\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Beluga\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7CXL\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u8ba9GPU\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3aGPU\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5171\u4eab\u8bbf\u95ee\u6d77\u91cf\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

This paper proposes an optimized hybrid K-means clustering and Genetic Algorithm (SK-means GA) to improve the pilot assignment efficiency, achieving a 29.3% reduction in convergence time (82s vs. 116s for conventional GA). A parallel implementation (PK-means GA) is developed on an FPGA using Vivado High-Level Synthesis Tools (HLST) to further enhance the run-time performance, accelerating convergence to 3.5 milliseconds. Within Vivado implementation, different optimization techniques such as loop unrolling, pipelining, and function inlining are applied to realize the reported speedup.

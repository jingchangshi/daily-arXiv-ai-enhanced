In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based\naccelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting\noperations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical\ntrade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively\nreduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary\nrasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG\ngroups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across\ntiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During\nrasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small\ntiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG\nenables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping\ntiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with\nthe original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage.

However, the general case with arbitrary\nconcave speedup functions -- which more accurately capture real-world workloads\n-- has remained open.\n  In this paper, we solve this open problem by developing optimal scheduling\nalgorithms for parallel jobs under general concave speedup functions. We first\ndiscover a fundamental and broadly-applicable rule for optimal parallel\nscheduling, namely the Consistent Derivative Ratio (CDR) Rule, which states\nthat the ratio of the derivatives of the speedup functions across active jobs\nremains constant over time. To efficiently compute the optimal allocations that\nsatisfy the CDR Rule, we propose the General Water-Filling (GWF) method, a more\ngeneral version of classical water-filling in wireless communications.\nCombining these insights, we design the SmartFill Algorithm to solve the\ngeneral scheduling problem.

For a broad class of so-called\n\\emph{regular} speedup functions, SmartFill yields closed-form optimal\nsolutions, while for non-regular functions it efficiently computes the optimum\nwith low complexity.

Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write\nstrategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in\nthe critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we\npropose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine\nspecifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained\nsetups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that\ndrive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update\ndominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage\ntier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies\nI/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload\nto offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and\nconcurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward\nand update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that\nMLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\\times$ faster iterations compared to the\nstate-of-the-art LLM training runtimes."}

To\naddress these issues, we present eEnergy-Split, an energy-efficient framework\nthat utilizes split learning (SL) to enable collaborative model training\nwithout direct data sharing or heavy computation on edge devices. By\ndistributing the model between edge devices and a central server, eEnergy-Split\nreduces on-device energy usage by up to 86 percent compared to federated\nlearning (FL) while safeguarding data privacy. Moreover, SL improves\nclassification accuracy by up to 6.2 percent over FL on ResNet-18 and by more\nmodest amounts on GoogleNet and MobileNetV2. We propose an optimal edge\ndeployment algorithm and a UAV trajectory planning strategy that solves the\nTraveling Salesman Problem (TSP) exactly to minimize flight cost and extend and\nmaximize communication rounds. Comprehensive evaluations on agricultural pest\ndatasets reveal that eEnergy-Split lowers UAV energy consumption compared to\nbaseline methods and boosts overall accuracy by up to 17 percent. Notably, the\nenergy efficiency of SL is shown to be model-dependent-yielding substantial\nsavings in lightweight models like MobileNet, while communication and memory\noverheads may reduce efficiency gains in deeper networks. These results\nhighlight the potential of combining SL with energy-aware design to deliver a\nscalable, privacy-preserving solution for resource-constrained smart farming\nenvironments."}

However, emerging DNN models such as large language models,\nstate space models increasingly rely on compound operations-structured\ncompositions of multiple basic operations-which introduce new challenges for\ndataflow optimization and minimizing off-chip memory traffic. Moreover, as\nmodel size continues to grow, deployment across spatially distributed compute\nclusters becomes essential, requiring frequent and complex collective\ncommunication. Existing dataflow optimization frameworks and performance models\neither focus on single operations or lack explicit modeling of collective\ncommunication cost, limiting their applicability to modern workloads.\n  To address these limitations, we propose, a framework for modeling and\noptimizing dataflow for compound operations on machine learning accelerators.\nCOMET introduces a novel representation that explicitly models collective\ncommunication across spatial clusters, along with latency and energy cost\nmodels that account for both GEMM and non-GEMM operation level dependencies\nwithin compound operations. We demonstrate COMET's capabilities to analyze and\noptimize dataflows for compound operations such as GEMM--Softmax,\nGEMM--LayerNorm, and self-attention, across both edge and cloud accelerator\nconfigurations. Our collective-aware modeling enables exploration of a broader\nmapping space, leading to improved performance and energy efficiency.\nSpecifically, our optimized dataflows achieve up to 1.42$\\times$ speedup for\nGEMM-Softmax, 3.46$\\times$ for GEMM-LayerNorm and 1.82$\\times$ for\nself-attention compared to unfused baselines."}

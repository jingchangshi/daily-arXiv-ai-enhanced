In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2Δ$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.\n  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2Δ+ \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second."}

A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irrevocably finalizes a prefix.\n  We present Majorum, an ebb-and-flow construction whose dynamically available component builds on a quorum-based protocol (TOB-SVD). Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot. In particular, when conditions remain favourable, each slot finalizes the next block extending the previously finalized one."}

However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments."}

This paper presents Hummingbird, an SLO-oriented GPU scheduling system that overcomes these challenges by enabling microsecond-scale preemption on closed-source GPUs while effectively harvesting idle GPU time slices. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse GPU architectures reveal that Hummingbird improves the SLO attainment of high-priority tasks by 9.7x and 3.5x compared to the state-of-the-art spatial and temporal-sharing approaches. When compared to executing exclusively, the SLO attainment of the high-priority task, collocating with low-priority tasks on Hummingbird, only drops by less than 1%. Meanwhile, the throughput of the low-priority task outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal-sharing approaches by 2.4x. Hummingbird demonstrates significant effectiveness in ensuring the SLO while enhancing GPU utilization."}

We also introduce an experimental suite using diverse simulated and emulated scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the toolchain against real-world challenges, including resource exhaustion, node failures, and carbon intensity fluctuations.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) create new opportunities for proof automation: modern LLMs not only generate proof scripts, but also support agentic behavior, exploring codebases and iteratively refining their outputs against prover feedback. These advances enable an emerging scheme where LLM-based agents undertake most proof engineering under human guidance. Humans provide mathematical insight (definitions, theorems, proof strategies); agents handle the mechanical work of proof development. We call this scheme agentic proof automation. We present this scheme through a case study: mechanizing the semantic type soundness of a sophisticated formal system, System Capless, in Lean 4, comprising over 14,000 lines of code. Using off-the-shelf LLM agents with a single lightweight proof-checking tool, the agents completed 189 proof engineering tasks with an 87% success rate, only 16% requiring human intervention. The case study demonstrates that agents are capable proof engineers that substantially boost productivity, though they fall short in creative reasoning and still require human guidance in certain cases. We release an interactive explorer where readers can examine all agent interactions; the mechanization is open-sourced for experiments and extensions."}

However, the ideas of logic programming have been met with resistance in other programming communities, and have not generally been adopted by other paradigms and languages. This paper proposes a novel way to incorporate logic programming in an existing codebase in a typed functional programming language. Our approach integrates with the host language without sacrificing static typing, and leverages strengths of typed functional programming such as polymorphism and higher-order. We do so by combining three ideas. First, we use the extensible types technique to allow values of the host language to contain logic variables. Second, we implement a unification algorithm that works for any data structure that supports certain operations.Third, we introduce a domain-specific language to define and query predicates. We demonstrate our proposal via a series of examples, and provide aids to make the notation convenient for users, showing that the proposed approach is not just technically possible but also practical. Our ideas have been implemented in the language Haskell with very good results."}

Based on the derived categorisation, we propose orthogonal slices, a new technique for formula enumeration that partitions the search space into manageable chunks, enabling two approaches for incremental candidate pruning. Using a combination of existing techniques for first-order (FO) invariant synthesis and the orthogonal slices implemented in our framework FORCE, we significantly accelerate a state-of-the-art algorithm for distributed system invariant inference. We also show that our approach facilitates composition of different invariant inference frameworks, allowing for novel optimisations."}

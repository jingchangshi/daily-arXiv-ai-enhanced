### [1] [Homomorphism Calculus for User-Defined Aggregations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15109)
*Ziteng Wang,Ruijie Fang,Linus Zheng,Dixin Tang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的同态凭算法，用于验证和否定用户定义聚合函数的同态性质，并为同态函数构建合并运算符，以支持高效的并行执行和增量计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Spark和Flink等数据处理框架支持用户定义聚合函数，但要实现高效执行，函数需要满足同态性质，以确保部分结果能够正确合并。

Method: 提出了一种新的同态函数微积分法，可以验证或否定UDAF是否为数据框同态。如果是同态函数，该方法还能构建对应的合并运算符。

Result: 实现了基于该函数微积分法的算法，并在真实世界的UDAF上进行了评估，表明该方法显著超过了两个领先的综合器。

Conclusion: 该新颖的同态函数微积分法为验证和构建高效聚合函数提供了有效的解决方案，能够支持并行执行和增量计算，在性能上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Flink provide built-in
support for user-defined aggregation functions (UDAFs), enabling the
integration of domain-specific logic. However, for these frameworks to support
\emph{efficient} UDAF execution, the function needs to satisfy a
\emph{homomorphism property}, which ensures that partial results from
independent computations can be merged correctly. Motivated by this problem,
this paper introduces a novel \emph{homomorphism calculus} that can both verify
and refute whether a UDAF is a dataframe homomorphism. If so, our calculus also
enables the construction of a corresponding merge operator which can be used
for incremental computation and parallel execution. We have implemented an
algorithm based on our proposed calculus and evaluate it on real-world UDAFs,
demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms two leading
synthesizers.

### [2] [Software Model Checking via Summary-Guided Search (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15137)
*Ruijie Fang,Zachary Kincaid,Thomas Reps*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPS是一个新的软件模型检测算法，通过组合式静态分析和两层搜索策略，能够高效发现程序安全证明和反例，在SV-COMP基准测试中优于现有最先进工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件模型检测工具在处理包含长输入依赖错误路径的程序时效率不高，需要一种既能证明安全性又能发现错误的高效算法

Method: 采用组合式摘要静态分析指导程序状态的有向搜索，使用静态分析摘要剪枝不可行路径并驱动测试生成，引入新颖的两层搜索策略和插装技术实现反驳完备性

Result: 在SV-COMP和现有文献基准测试中，GPS在解决基准数量和运行时间方面都优于最先进的软件模型检测器，包括SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops类别的顶级工具

Conclusion: GPS算法通过结合静态分析和定向搜索，实现了高效的程序验证和错误检测，特别是在处理复杂错误路径方面表现出色，同时保持了反驳完备性

Abstract: In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS.
GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the
program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The
summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible
paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS
can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs
that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that
renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long,
input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense
that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we
introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve
refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked
GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software
Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that
our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers
(including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in
terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.

### [3] [Big-Stop Semantics: A Simple Way to Get the Benefits of Small-Step Semantics in a Big-Step Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15157)
*David M Kahn,Jan Hoffmann,Runming Li*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 大步步式语义的扩展，通过归纳定义捕获分散计算，无需引入错误状态或复杂的推理规则


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大步步式语义无法描述分散计算的限制，同时保持大步步式语义的便捷性和简洁性

Method: 在标准大步步式推济规则基础上，添加少量额外规则定义评估判断，使其等价于小步步式过渡的自反传闭包

Result: 开发了big-stop语义方法，在类型化、非类型化和效果型PCF以及命令式语言中实现了分散计算的描述

Conclusion: 该方法在保持大步步式语义优势的同时，充分捕获了分散行为，比其他解决方案更简洁易用

Abstract: As evident in the programming language literature, many practitioners favor
specifying dynamic program behavior using big-step over small-step semantics.
Unlike small-step semantics, which must dwell on every intermediate program
state, big-step semantics conveniently jump directly to the ever-important
result of the computation. Big-step semantics also typically involve fewer
inference rules than their small-step counterparts. However, in exchange for
ergonomics, big-step semantics give up power: Small-step semantics describes
program behaviors that are outside the grasp of big-step semantics, notably
divergence. This work presents a little-known extension of big-step semantics
with inductive definitions that captures diverging computations without
introducing error states. This big-stop semantics is illustrated for typed,
untyped, and effectful variants of PCF, as well as a while-loop-based
imperative language. Big-stop semantics extends the standard big-step inference
rules with a few additional rules to define an evaluation judgment that is
equivalent to the reflexive-transitive closure of small-step transitions. This
simple extension contrasts with other solutions in the literature which
sacrifice ergonomics by introducing many additional inference rules, global
state, and/or less-commonly-understood reasoning principles like coinduction.

### [4] [Probabilistic Inference for Datalog with Correlated Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15166)
*Jingbo Wang,Shashin Halalingaiah,Weiyi Chen,Chao Wang,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Praline是Datalog的新扩展，用于处理输入相关性下的精确概率推理，通过约束优化和δ-精确算法实现可扩展的紧概率边界计算


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率逻辑编程语言（如ProbLog）未考虑输入事实间的统计相关性，导致概率推理结果不准确

Method: 将推理任务建模为约束优化问题，提出δ-精确推理算法，结合约束求解、静态分析和迭代优化

Result: 在包括侧信道分析在内的真实基准测试中，方法具有良好可扩展性并能提供紧概率边界

Conclusion: Praline成功解决了输入相关性下的精确概率推理问题，为复杂应用提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Probabilistic extensions of logic programming languages, such as ProbLog,
integrate logical reasoning with probabilistic inference to evaluate
probabilities of output relations; however, prior work does not account for
potential statistical correlations among input facts. This paper introduces
Praline, a new extension to Datalog designed for precise probabilistic
inference in the presence of (partially known) input correlations. We formulate
the inference task as a constrained optimization problem, where the solution
yields sound and precise probability bounds for output facts. However, due to
the complexity of the resulting optimization problem, this approach alone often
does not scale to large programs. To address scalability, we propose a more
efficient $\delta$-exact inference algorithm that leverages constraint solving,
static analysis, and iterative refinement. Our empirical evaluation on
challenging real-world benchmarks, including side-channel analysis,
demonstrates that our method not only scales effectively but also delivers
tight probability bounds.

### [5] [Exploring the Theory and Practice of Concurrency in the Entity-Component-System Pattern](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15264)
*Patrick Redmond,Jonathan Castello,José Manuel Calderón Trilla,Lindsey Kuper*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Core ECS形式化模型，抽象ECS模式的本质，识别出确定性并发行为类别，并发现现有ECS框架未充分利用确定性并发机会


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECS模式在游戏开发中广泛应用但缺乏严谨理解，现有解释过于关注具体框架细节或使用不完美比喻，需要抽象出ECS模式的本质

Method: 设计Core ECS形式化模型，抽象具体实现细节，识别确定性行为程序类别，并调研多个真实ECS框架进行比较分析

Result: 发现一类Core ECS程序无论调度如何都表现确定性行为，现有ECS框架均未充分利用确定性并发机会

Conclusion: 研究指出了新的ECS实现技术空间，可以更好地利用确定性并发机会，使ECS模式成为确定性构造的并发编程模型

Abstract: The Entity-Component-System (ECS) software design pattern, long used in game
development, encourages a clean separation of identity (entities), data
properties (components), and computational behaviors (systems). Programs
written using the ECS pattern are naturally concurrent, and the pattern offers
modularity, flexibility, and performance benefits that have led to a
proliferation of ECS frameworks. Nevertheless, the ECS pattern is little-known
and not well understood outside of a few domains. Existing explanations of the
ECS pattern tend to be mired in the concrete details of particular ECS
frameworks, or they explain the pattern in terms of imperfect metaphors or in
terms of what it is not. We seek a rigorous understanding of the ECS pattern
via the design of a formal model, Core ECS, that abstracts away the details of
specific implementations to reveal the essence of software using the ECS
pattern. We identify a class of Core ECS programs that behave deterministically
regardless of scheduling, enabling use of the ECS pattern as a
deterministic-by-construction concurrent programming model. With Core ECS as a
point of comparison, we then survey several real-world ECS frameworks and find
that they all leave opportunities for deterministic concurrency unexploited.
Our findings point out a space for new ECS implementation techniques that
better leverage such opportunities.

### [6] [Fair Termination for Resource-Aware Active Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15333)
*Francesco Dagnino,Paola Giannini,Violet Ka I Pun,Ulises Torrella*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种资源感知的主动对象核心计算法，通过类型系统确保程序的公平终止性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动对象系统是分布式计算和业务流程工作的重要模型，具有并发性和资源感知特性，需要开发相应的资源感知形式化方法。

Method: 结合顺序程序的分级语义和类型系统技术，以及同步会话的公平终止技术，开发了一种核心计算法。

Result: 开发了资源感知主动对象核心计算法，并通过类型系统确保良类型程序能够公平终止。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将顺序程序的分级语义技术与同步会话的公平终止技术结合，为资源感知主动对象模型提供了可靠的形式化基础。

Abstract: Active object systems are a model of distributed computation that has been
adopted for modelling distributed systems and business process workflows. This
field of modelling is, in essence, concurrent and resource-aware, motivating
the development of resource-aware formalisations on the active object model.
The contributions of this work are the development of a core calculus for
resource-aware active objects together with a type system ensuring that
well-typed programs are fairly terminating, i.e., they can always eventually
terminate. To achieve this, we combine techniques from graded semantics and
type systems, which are quite well understood for sequential programs, with
those for fair termination, which have been developed for synchronous~sessions.

### [7] [Compositional Symbolic Execution for the Next 700 Memory Models (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15576)
*Andreas Lööw,Seung Hoon Park,Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho,Sacha-Élie Ayoun,Opale Sjöstedt,Philippa Gardner*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文为内存模型参数化组合符号执行平台提供了新的形式化基础，支持分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析，并在Rocq定理证明器中实现和验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合符号执行工具虽然利用分离逻辑进行验证和错误发现，但缺乏内存模型参数化的形式化基础，限制了平台的灵活性和适用范围。

Method: 基于Gillian平台的启发，在Rocq定理证明器中机械化形式化基础，支持多种内存模型（包括C和CHERI），涵盖分离逻辑和错误分离逻辑分析。

Result: 成功建立了内存模型参数化的形式化框架，验证了多种内存模型的实例化，支持标准分离逻辑定义以确保与其他工具的互操作性。

Conclusion: 该工作为内存模型参数化组合符号执行平台提供了坚实的形式化基础，增强了平台的灵活性、适用范围和分析能力。

Abstract: Multiple successful compositional symbolic execution (CSE) tools and
platforms exploit separation logic (SL) for compositional verification and/or
incorrectness separation logic (ISL) for compositional bug-finding, including
VeriFast, Viper, Gillian, CN, and Infer-Pulse. Previous work on the Gillian
platform, the only CSE platform that is parametric on the memory model, meaning
that it can be instantiated to different memory models, suggests that the
ability to use custom memory models allows for more flexibility in supporting
analysis of a wide range of programming languages, for implementing custom
automation, and for improving performance. However, the literature lacks a
satisfactory formal foundation for memory-model-parametric CSE platforms.
  In this paper, inspired by Gillian, we provide a new formal foundation for
memory-model-parametric CSE platforms. Our foundation advances the state of the
art in four ways. First, we mechanise our foundation (in the interactive
theorem prover Rocq). Second, we validate our foundation by instantiating it to
a broad range of memory models, including models for C and CHERI. Third,
whereas previous memory-model-parametric work has only covered SL analyses, we
cover both SL and ISL analyses. Fourth, our foundation is based on standard
definitions of SL and ISL (including definitions of function specification
validity, to ensure sound interoperation with other tools and platforms also
based on standard definitions).

### [8] [Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750)
*Celeste Barnaby,Qiaochu Chen,Ramya Ramalingam,Osbert Bastani,Isil Dillig*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的主动学习方法SmartLabel，通过约束符合性评估(CCE)处理神经符号程序合成中的神经网络误预测问题，显著提高了合成正确程序的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在神经符号程序合成中无法处理神经网络误预测问题，导致返回非预期程序，需要新的技术来应对这一挑战。

Method: 基于约束符合性评估(CCE)的新策略，考虑神经误预测和用户反馈，迭代优化CCE精度直到所有剩余程序保证观察等价。

Result: SmartLabel在三个神经符号领域中，98%的基准测试成功识别真实程序，平均只需不到5轮用户交互，而先前技术最多只能达到65%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了神经符号程序合成中的主动学习挑战，显著提升了合成准确性和用户交互效率。

Abstract: The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the
desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction.
While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting,
such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of
neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates
neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques
can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to
mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning
technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network
mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called
constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural
mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed
method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are
guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in
a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic
domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth
program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction
on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to
converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型声明式数据管道架构，通过模块化框架在Apache Spark中集成机器学习能力，显著提升了开发效率、协作效率和系统性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式数据处理系统在性能与代码可维护性、开发效率之间的平衡问题，特别是在大规模协作环境中团队间高通信开销和多组协调开发的复杂性

Method: 采用声明式数据管道架构，结合称为Pipes的逻辑计算单元，建立清晰的组件边界和标准化接口，替代传统的微服务方法

Result: 企业案例显示开发效率提升50%，协作/故障排除从数周缩短到数天，可扩展性提升500倍，吞吐量提升10倍；学术实验显示吞吐量至少快5.7倍，CPU利用率达99%

Conclusion: 该架构通过架构决策、实现策略和性能优化，为构建可扩展、可维护的数据处理系统提供了有效方案，成功平衡了系统性能与开发速度

Abstract: Modern distributed data processing systems face significant challenges in
balancing system performance with code maintainability and developer
productivity, particularly when integrating machine learning capabilities at
scale. In large collaborative environments, these challenges are amplified by
high communication overhead between teams and the complexity of coordinating
development across multiple groups. This paper presents a novel "Declarative
Data Pipeline" architecture that addresses these challenges while processing
billions of records with high accuracy and efficiency. Our architecture
introduces a modular framework that seamlessly integrates machine learning
capabilities within Apache Spark by combining logical computation units that we
refer as Pipes, departing from traditional microservice-based approaches. By
establishing clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces, we achieve
both modularity and system optimization without sacrificing maintainability.
The enterprise case study demonstrate substantial improvements in multiple
dimensions: development efficiency improved by 50%,
collaboration/troubleshooting efforts compressed from weeks to days,
performance improved by 500x in scalability and by 10x in throughput. The
academic experiment also proves at least 5.7x faster in throughput with 99% CPU
utilization than non-framework implementations. This paper details the
architectural decisions, implementation strategies, and performance
optimizations that enable these improvements, providing insights for building
scalable, maintainable data processing systems that effectively balance system
performance with development velocity.

### [10] [Databelt: A Continuous Data Path for Serverless Workflows in the 3D Compute Continuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15351)
*Cynthia Marcelino,Leonard Guelmino,Thomas Pusztai,Stefan Nastic*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Databelt是一个面向3D计算连续体动态环境的无服务器工作流状态管理框架，通过SLO感知状态传播和函数状态融合机制，显著降低状态访问延迟和网络开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D（边缘-云-空间）计算连续体的动态环境中，无服务器函数依赖远程存储服务会导致高延迟和网络通信开销，特别是在卫星移动导致网络拓扑频繁变化的情况下，函数需要多跳访问云服务，造成高延迟状态访问和不必要的数据传输。

Method: Databelt引入SLO感知状态传播机制，使函数状态在轨道上持续移动，主动将状态卸载到最合适的节点；同时采用函数状态融合机制，为共享同一运行时的函数抽象状态管理，减少冗余网络和存储操作。

Result: 实验结果显示，Databelt将工作流执行时间减少高达66%，吞吐量提高50%；函数状态融合机制将存储操作延迟降低高达20%，通过减少同一运行时内函数的重复存储请求。

Conclusion: Databelt能够在高度动态的网络环境（如3D连续体）中确保无服务器工作流的高效执行，通过智能状态管理和优化显著提升性能。

Abstract: Typically, serverless functions rely on remote storage services for managing
state, which can result in increased latency and network communication
overhead. In a dynamic environment such as the 3D (Edge-Cloud-Space) Compute
Continuum, serverless functions face additional challenges due to frequent
changes in network topology. As satellites move in and out of the range of
ground stations, functions must make multiple hops to access cloud services,
leading to high-latency state access and unnecessary data transfers. In this
paper, we present Databelt, a state management framework for serverless
workflows designed for the dynamic environment of the 3D Compute Continuum.
Databelt introduces an SLO-aware state propagation mechanism that enables the
function state to move continuously in orbit. Databelt proactively offloads
function states to the most suitable node, such that when functions execute,
the data is already present on the execution node or nearby, thus minimizing
state access latency and reducing the number of network hops. Additionally,
Databelt introduces a function state fusion mechanism that abstracts state
management for functions sharing the same serverless runtime. When functions
are fused, Databelt seamlessly retrieves their state as a group, reducing
redundant network and storage operations and improving overall workflow
efficiency. Our experimental results show that Databelt reduces workflow
execution time by up to 66% and increases throughput by 50% compared to the
baselines. Furthermore, our results show that Databelt function state fusion
reduces storage operations latency by up to 20%, by reducing repetitive storage
requests for functions within the same runtime, ensuring efficient execution of
serverless workflows in highly dynamic network environments such as the 3D
Continuum.

*Caterina Feletti,Paola Flocchini,Debasish Pattanayak,Giuseppe Prencipe,Nicola Santoro*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文解决了机器人编舞问题，证明了在LUMI模型和顺序调度器下，可以消除现有编舞问题的各种限制约束，实现通用编舞能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编舞问题需要各种严格限制（如模式重复、周期性、对称性等），限制了实际应用。本文旨在探索如何通过LUMI模型和顺序调度器来消除这些限制

Method: 采用LUMI模型（机器人配备有限颜色调色板的灯光）和顺序调度器，利用分布式计数器机制实现通用编舞算法，支持非刚性移动

Result: 证明了在LUMI模型下，通用编舞问题的可行性，但可行编舞序列长度受限于可用颜色数量和机器人数量组合。提供了具体的算法实现

Conclusion: LUMI模型和顺序调度器的结合使得通用编舞成为可能，突破了传统编舞问题的各种限制，为机器人群体编舞提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The Dancing problem requires a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots to form
a sequence of patterns, aka perform a choreography. Existing work has proven
that some crucial restrictions on choreographies and initial configurations
(e.g., on repetitions of patterns, periodicity, symmetries,
contractions/expansions) must hold so that the Dancing problem can be solved
under certain robot models. Here, we prove that these necessary constraints can
be dropped by considering the LUMI model (i.e., where robots are endowed with a
light whose color can be chosen from a constant-size palette) under the quite
unexplored sequential scheduler. We formalize the class of Universal Dancing
problems which require a swarm of $n$ robots starting from any initial
configuration to perform a (periodic or finite) sequence of arbitrary patterns,
only provided that each pattern consists of $n$ vertices (including
multiplicities). However, we prove that, to be solvable under LUMI, the length
of the feasible choreographies is bounded by the compositions of $n$ into the
number of colors available to the robots. We provide an algorithm solving the
Universal Dancing problem by exploiting the peculiar capability of sequential
robots to implement a distributed counter mechanism. Even assuming non-rigid
movements, our algorithm ensures spatial homogeneity of the performed
choreography.

### [12] [Lower Bounds for $k$-Set Agreement in Fault-Prone Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15562)
*Pierre Fraigniaud,Minh Hang Nguyen,Ami Paz,Ulrich Schmid,Hugo Rincon Galeana*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文为同步消息传递系统中k-set agreement问题提出了新的下界，推广了先前在完全网络和任意无向网络中的结果，基于拓扑证明方法和shellable carrier maps技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的k-set agreement下界主要针对完全网络或特定网络拓扑，缺乏对任意有向通信网络的通用下界分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，为任意网络拓扑下的同步系统提供统一的下界理论。

Method: 采用拓扑证明方法，基于shellable carrier maps序列，通过在前t/k轮中每轮崩溃k个进程来保持协议复形的高连通性，并使用Sperner引理风格的论证证明k-set agreement的不可能性。

Result: 成功推导出任意有向通信网络中k-set agreement的新下界，推广了先前的结果，并证明了可以使用基于Kuhn三角剖分的指数级更小的输入复形。

Conclusion: 该研究为分布式系统中k-set agreement问题提供了更通用的下界理论框架，拓扑证明方法具有很好的扩展性，对理解网络拓扑对协议复杂性的影响具有重要意义。

Abstract: We develop a new lower bound for k-set agreement in synchronous
message-passing systems connected by an arbitrary directed communication
network, where up to t processes may crash. Our result thus generalizes the
t/k+1 lower bound for complete networks in the t-resilient model by Chaudhuri,
Herlihy, Lynch, and Tuttle [JACM'00]. Moreover, it generalizes two lower bounds
for oblivious algorithms in synchronous systems connected by an arbitrary
undirected communication network known to the processes, namely, the domination
number-based lower bound by Castaneda, Fraigniaud, Paz, Rajsbaum, Roy, and
Travers [TCS'21] for failure-free processes, and the radius-based lower bound
in the t-resilient model by Fraigniaud, Nguyen, and Paz [STACS'24].
  Our topological proof non-trivially generalizes and extends the
connectivity-based approach for the complete network, as presented in the book
by Herlihy, Kozlov, and Rajsbaum (2013). It is based on a sequence of shellable
carrier maps that, starting from a shellable input complex, determine the
evolution of the protocol complex: During the first t/k rounds, carrier maps
that crash exactly k processes per round are used, ensuring high connectivity
of their images. A Sperner's lemma style argument is used to prove that k-set
agreement is still impossible by that round. From round t/k+1 up to our lower
bound, we employ a novel carrier map that maintains high connectivity. Our
proof also provides a strikingly simple lower bound for k-set agreement in
synchronous systems with an arbitrary communication network with initial
crashes. We express the resulting additional agreement overhead via an
appropriately defined radius of the communication graphs. Finally, we prove
that the usual input pseudosphere complex for k-set agreement can be replaced
by an exponentially smaller input complex based on Kuhn triangulations, which
we prove to be also shellable.

Conclusion: 该方法被集成到TurboMind高性能推理引擎中，作为LMDeploy项目的一部分开源发布，为混合精度LLM推理提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Mixed-precision inference techniques reduce the memory and computational
demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) by applying hybrid precision formats to
model weights, activations, and KV caches. This work introduces mixed-precision
LLM inference techniques that encompass (i) systematic memory and compute
optimization across hierarchical storage and tensor core architectures, and
(ii) comprehensive end-to-end mixed-precision optimization across diverse
precision formats and hardware configurations. Our approach features two novel
mixed-precision pipelines designed for optimal hardware utilization: a General
Matrix Multiply (GEMM) pipeline that optimizes matrix operations through
offline weight packing and online acceleration, and an attention pipeline that
enables efficient attention computation with arbitrary Query, Key, and Value
precision combinations. The key implementation of the pipelines includes (i)
hardware-aware weight packing for automatic format optimization, (ii) adaptive
head alignment for efficient attention computation, (iii) instruction-level
parallelism for memory hierarchy exploitation, and (iv) KV memory loading
pipeline for enhanced inference efficiency. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations across 16 popular LLMs and 4 representative GPU architectures.
Results demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 61% lower serving latency
(30% on average) and up to 156% higher throughput (58% on average) in
mixed-precision workloads compared to existing mixed-precision frameworks,
establishing consistent performance improvements across all tested
configurations and hardware types. This work is integrated into TurboMind, a
high-performance inference engine of the LMDeploy project, which is
open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy.

Abstract: Stateful serverless workflows consist of multiple serverless functions that
access state on a remote database. Developers sometimes add a cache layer
between the serverless runtime and the database to improve I/O latency.
However, in a serverless environment, functions in the same workflow may be
scheduled to different nodes with different caches, which can cause
non-intuitive anomalies. This paper presents CausalMesh, a novel approach to
causally consistent caching in environments where a computation may migrate
from one machine to another, such as in serverless computing. CausalMesh is the
first cache system that supports coordination-free and abort-free read/write
operations and read transactions when clients roam among multiple servers.
CausalMesh also supports read-write transactional causal consistency in the
presence of client roaming, but at the cost of abort-freedom.
  We have formally verified CausalMesh's protocol in Dafny, and our
experimental evaluation shows that CausalMesh has lower latency and higher
throughput than existing proposals

Abstract: High-throughput imaging workflows, such as Parallel Rapid Imaging with
Spectroscopic Mapping (PRISM), generate data at rates that exceed conventional
real-time processing capabilities. We present a scalable FPGA-based
preprocessing pipeline for real-time denoising, implemented via High-Level
Synthesis (HLS) and optimized for DRAM-backed buffering. Our architecture
performs frame subtraction and averaging directly on streamed image data,
minimizing latency through burst-mode AXI4 interfaces. The resulting kernel
operates below the inter-frame interval, enabling inline denoising and reducing
dataset size for downstream CPU/GPU analysis. Validated under PRISM-scale
acquisition, this modular FPGA framework offers a practical solution for
latency-sensitive imaging workflows in spectroscopy and microscopy.

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

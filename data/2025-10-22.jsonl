We present the general form of a\nvector-symbolic representation of the five Lisp elementary functions, lambda\nexpressions, and other auxiliary functions, found in the Lisp 1.5 specification\nMcCarthy (1960), which is near minimal and sufficient for Turing-completeness.\nOur specific implementation uses holographic reduced representations Plate\n(1995), with a lookup table cleanup memory. Lisp, as all Turing-complete\nlanguages, is a Cartesian closed category, unusual in its proximity to the\nmathematical abstraction. We discuss the mathematics, the purpose, and the\nsignificance of demonstrating vector-symbolic architectures' Cartesian-closure,\nas well as the importance of explicitly including cleanup memories in the\nspecification of the architecture."}

Our design relies on two sets of\nideas: (1) a new abstraction of token sequences that captures the separability\nof tokens in a sequence while supporting their efficient manipulation, and (2)\na combination of verified data structures and optimizations, including Huet's\nzippers and memoized derivatives, to achieve practical performance. We\nimplemented ZipLex in Scala and verified its correctness, including\ninvertibility, using the Stainless verifier. Our evaluation demonstrates that\nZipLex supports realistic applications such as JSON processing and lexers of\nprogramming languages. In comparison to other verified lexers (which do not\nenforce invertibility), ZipLex is 4x slower than Coqlex and two orders of\nmagnitude faster than Verbatim++, showing that verified invertibility can be\nachieved without prohibitive cost."}

The domain of industrial Cyber-Physical\nSystems (CPS) is no exception, as raw data typically consists of large amounts\nof time-series data logging the system's status in regular time intervals. Such\ndata has to be sanity checked and preprocessed to be consumable by data-centric\nworkflows. We introduce CPSLint, a Domain-Specific Language designed to provide\ndata preparation for industrial CPS. We build up on the fact that many raw data\ncollections in the CPS domain require similar actions to render them suitable\nfor Machine-Learning (ML) solutions, e.g., Fault Detection and Identification\n(FDI) workflows, yet still vary enough to hope for one universally applicable\nsolution.\n  CPSLint's main features include type checking and enforcing constraints\nthrough validation and remediation for data columns, such as imputing missing\ndata from surrounding rows. More advanced features cover inference of extra\nCPS-specific data structures, both column-wise and row-wise. For instance, as\nrow-wise structures, descriptive execution phases are an effective method of\ndata compartmentalisation are extracted and prepared for ML-assisted FDI\nworkflows.

Federated learning approaches provide a\nmodel-aggregation mechanism among edge devices to achieve collaborative\ntraining, while ensuring data security, communication efficiency, and sharing\ncomputational overheads. On the other hand, limited transmission resources and\ncomplex communication environments remain significant bottlenecks to the\nefficient collaborations among edge devices, particularly within large-scale\nnetworks. To address such issues, this paper proposes an over-the-air (OTA)\nanalog aggregation method designed for the distributed swarm learning (DSL),\ntermed DSL-OTA, aiming to enhance communication efficiency, enable effective\ncooperation, and ensure privacy preserving. Incorporating multi-worker\nselection strategy with over-the-air aggregation not only makes the standard\nDSL based on single best worker contributing to global model update to become\nmore federated, but also secures the aggregation from potential risks of data\nleakage.

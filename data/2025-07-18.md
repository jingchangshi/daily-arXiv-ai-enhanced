### [1] [Dual-Numbers Reverse AD for Functional Array Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12640)
*Tom Smeding,Mikołaj Konarski,Simon Peyton Jones,Andrew Fitzgibbon*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对多维数组的对偶数反向模式自动微分方法，通过批量操作变换(BOT)、数组语言的对偶数算法提升和符号解释实现了高效的端到端编译管道，但牺牲了对高阶代码的通用支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对偶数构造虽然在前向模式自动微分中表现良好，但在反向模式自动微分中，特别是在数组程序上的实际性能表现不佳。现有方法缺乏对多维数组的一流支持，性能开销较大。

Method: 提出了三个松耦合组件：(1)语义保持的向量化代码变换(批量操作变换BOT)；(2)将基本对偶数反向AD算法提升到主要为一阶的数组语言；(3)符号解释实现端到端编译管道。支持特定的高阶数组组合子如'build'、'gather'和'scatter'。

Result: 实现了对多维数组的一流支持，几乎没有性能开销。BOT能够消除输入程序中对AD至关重要的高阶特性，使得将对偶数提升为"对偶数组"的简单技巧能够无需大幅修改就能工作。

Conclusion: 虽然在过程中失去了对偶数AD的一些良好的通用化特性(特别是对高阶代码的支持)，但通过精心选择的高阶数组组合子集合，成功实现了高效的多维数组反向模式自动微分，为数组程序的自动微分提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The standard dual-numbers construction works well for forward-mode automatic
differentiation (AD) and is attractive due to its simplicity; recently, it also
has been adapted to reverse-mode AD, but practical performance, especially on
array programs, leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper we introduce
first-class support for multidimensional arrays in dual-numbers reverse-mode AD
with little to no performance overhead. The algorithm consists of three
loosely-coupled components: a semantics-preserving vectorisation code
transformation (the bulk-operation transform or BOT), a fairly straightforward
lifting of the basic dual-numbers reverse AD algorithm to a mostly first-order
array language, and symbolic interpretation to achieve an end-to-end
compilation pipeline. Unfortunately, we lose some of the nice generalisable
aspects of dual-numbers AD in the process, most importantly support for
higher-order code.
  We do support some higher-order array combinators, but only a
carefully-chosen set: 'build' (elementwise array construction), 'gather' and
'scatter'. In return, the BOT can eliminate the essential (for AD)
higher-orderness of the input program, meaning that AD gets essentially
presented with a first-order program. This allows the naive trick of lifting
dual numbers to "dual arrays" to work without much modification.

### [2] [Formal Verification for JavaScript Regular Expressions: a Proven Semantics and its Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13091)
*Aurèle Barrière,Victor Deng,Clément Pit-Claudel*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种机械化、简洁、实用、完整且经过验证的现代正则表达式语言语义，支持回溯语义，并通过实际应用展示了其价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为现代正则表达式语言提供一种可靠的语义定义，填补现有规范和其他形式化工作的不足，尤其是对回溯树的完整记录。

Method: 通过证明其与ECMAScript规范的行级嵌入等价来确保语义的忠实性，并在Rocq证明助手中实现所有定义和结果。

Result: 提出了正则表达式上下文等价的新概念，并首次对PikeVM算法进行了形式化证明。

Conclusion: 该语义不仅捕获最高优先级匹配，还记录了所有可能的匹配及其优先级，为实际应用提供了更全面的支持。

Abstract: We present the first mechanized, succinct, practical, complete, and
proven-faithful semantics for a modern regular expression language with
backtracking semantics. We ensure its faithfulness by proving it equivalent to
a preexisting line-by-line embedding of the official ECMAScript specification
of JavaScript regular expressions. We demonstrate its practicality by
presenting two real-world applications. First, a new notion of contextual
equivalence for modern regular expressions, which we use to prove or disprove
rewrites drawn from previous work. Second, the first formal proof of the PikeVM
algorithm used in many real-world engines. In contrast with the specification
and other formalization work, our semantics captures not only the top-priority
match, but a full backtracking tree recording all possible matches and their
respective priority. All our definitions and results have been mechanized in
the Rocq proof assistant.

### [3] [Towards Formal Verification of LLM-Generated Code from Natural Language Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13290)
*Aaron Councilman,David Fu,Aryan Gupta,Chengxiao Wang,David Grove,Yu-Xiong Wang,Vikram Adve*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过形式化查询语言验证LLM生成的代码，确保其符合用户意图，并在Ansible语言中实现验证系统Astrogator。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码常存在错误且用户难以检测，需提供形式化正确性保证以提升AI代码助手体验。

Method: 结合形式化查询语言表示用户意图，验证LLM生成代码，并在Ansible中实现验证系统Astrogator。

Result: 在21个代码生成任务中，验证器能验证83%的正确代码并识别92%的错误代码。

Conclusion: 形式化验证方法可有效提升LLM生成代码的可靠性，支持自然语言编程。

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by
taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However,
LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature
suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to
offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees
could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable
natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge.
To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language
that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural
language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using
such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the
user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the
Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a
calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic
interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21
code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of
cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

### [4] [Building State Machine Replication Using Practical Network Synchrony](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12792)
*Yiliang Wan,Nitin Shivaraman,Akshaye Shenoi,Xiang Liu,Tao Luo,Jialin Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强同步网络设计的分布式复制协议Chora，通过优化网络架构和协议设计，显著提升了吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据中心系统可以设计为在常见情况下提供强同步性，以优化分布式协议的性能。

Method: 结合内核旁路网络、多线程架构和宽松的轮次长度，设计了一个同步网络，并基于此开发了复制协议Chora。

Result: Chora在实验中比现有单领导者和多领导者协议的吞吐量分别提高了255%和109%。

Conclusion: 强同步网络设计是可行的，Chora协议展示了其在分布式系统中的高效性能。

Abstract: Distributed systems, such as state machine replication, are critical
infrastructures for modern applications. Practical distributed protocols make
minimum assumptions about the underlying network: They typically assume a
partially synchronous or fully asynchronous network model. In this work, we
argue that modern data center systems can be designed to provide strong
synchrony properties in the common case, where servers move in synchronous
lock-step rounds. We prove this hypothesis by engineering a practical design
that uses a combination of kernel-bypass network, multithreaded architecture,
and loosened round length, achieving a tight round bound under 2us. Leveraging
our engineered networks with strong synchrony, we co-design a new replication
protocol, Chora. Chora exploits the network synchrony property to efficiently
pipeline multiple replication instances, while allowing all replicas to propose
in parallel without extra coordination. Through experiments, we show that Chora
achieves 255% and 109% improvement in throughput over state-of-the-art
single-leader and multi-leader protocols, respectively.

### [5] [Autonomous Resource Management in Microservice Systems via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12879)
*Yujun Zou,Nia Qi,Yingnan Deng,Zhihao Xue,Ming Gong,Wuyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的微服务资源调度方法，优化资源分配、降低延迟并提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统微服务架构中资源分配不均、高延迟和吞吐量不足的问题。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的智能调度算法，通过代理与环境的交互持续优化资源分配策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了系统响应速度和吞吐量，优化了资源利用率并降低了能耗。

Conclusion: 相比传统静态资源分配方法，强化学习模型更具适应性和优化能力，能实时调整策略以应对动态变化的环境。

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based method for microservice
resource scheduling and optimization, aiming to address issues such as uneven
resource allocation, high latency, and insufficient throughput in traditional
microservice architectures. In microservice systems, as the number of services
and the load increase, efficiently scheduling and allocating resources such as
computing power, memory, and storage becomes a critical research challenge. To
address this, the paper employs an intelligent scheduling algorithm based on
reinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent and the
environment, the resource allocation strategy is continuously optimized. In the
experiments, the paper considers different resource conditions and load
scenarios, evaluating the proposed method across multiple dimensions, including
response time, throughput, resource utilization, and cost efficiency. The
experimental results show that the reinforcement learning-based scheduling
method significantly improves system response speed and throughput under low
load and high concurrency conditions, while also optimizing resource
utilization and reducing energy consumption. Under multi-dimensional resource
conditions, the proposed method can consider multiple objectives and achieve
optimized resource scheduling. Compared to traditional static resource
allocation methods, the reinforcement learning model demonstrates stronger
adaptability and optimization capability. It can adjust resource allocation
strategies in real time, thereby maintaining good system performance in
dynamically changing load and resource environments.

### [6] [Modular SAIL: dream or reality?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12471)
*Petr Kourzanov,Anmol*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过模块化SAIL提升RISC-V ISA的模块化组合性，覆盖仿真、模拟和验证等开发流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RISC-V ISA模块化在实际开发流程中的组合性问题，以充分利用其模块化特性。

Method: 引入模块化SAIL，对SAIL-RISCV黄金模型进行组合性改进，支持仿真器级别的模块化。

Result: 实验表明，模块化SAIL在功能和性能上与原版仿真器一致，支持静态和动态绑定。

Conclusion: 模块化SAIL为RISC-V开发流程的组合性提供了可行方案，未来可进一步优化SAIL编译器。

Abstract: In order to truly benefit from RISC-V ISA modularity, the community has to
address the issue of compositionality, going beyond modules at the
specification level covering larger subsets of the RISC-V development flow
including emulation, simulation and verification. In this paper we introduce
modular SAIL, an experiment to inject compositionality into the SAIL-RISCV
golden model. We show that it is, in principle, not difficult to adapt the
SAIL-RISCV flow (and ideally the SAIL compiler itself) to support modules at
the emulator level. We back our findings by a comparative study of the
resulting pluggable emulator's performance using both static and dynamic
binding, which both exhibit same functional behavior as the original monolithic
emulator (aka RISC-V ISS).

### [7] [An ultra-low-power CGRA for accelerating Transformers at the edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12904)
*Rohit Prasad*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对边缘设备的低功耗CGRA架构，用于加速Transformer模型中的GEMM操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在边缘设备上部署时面临高计算需求问题，需要低功耗解决方案。

Method: 设计了一种4x4 PE阵列和4x2 MOB的CGRA架构，采用无交换环形互连网络优化数据流。

Result: 该架构降低了内存带宽需求，提升了数据重用，减少了功耗和延迟。

Conclusion: 为边缘设备部署复杂机器学习模型提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural
language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational
demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This
paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA)
architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource
constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4
array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and
dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE
operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A
switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency
by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for
centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient
dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of
transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine
learning models on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假芯片在本科电子实验室中日益普遍，威胁实验完整性，但可以转化为教学资源。

Method: 通过让学生动手诊断假芯片（测量电流、分析波形、故障排除）进行教学。

Result: 学生更深入理解了模拟电路、供应链安全和实际工程问题。

Conclusion: 利用假芯片问题作为教学工具，能有效提升学生的实践能力和工程意识。

Abstract: This work-in-progress paper presents a case study in which counterfeit TL074
operational amplifiers, discovered in a junior level electronics course, became
the basis for a hands on learning experience. Counterfeit integrated circuits
(IC) are increasingly common, posing a significant threat to the integrity of
undergraduate electronics laboratories. Instead of simply replacing the
counterfeit components, we turned the issue into a teaching moment. Students
engaged in hands-on diagnostics measuring current, analyzing waveforms, and
troubleshooting. By working with fake chip components, they gained deeper
insight into analog circuits, supply chain security, and practical engineering.

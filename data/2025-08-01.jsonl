This has multiple\napplications in program analysis (e.g. cost analysis, loop acceleration,\ndeclarative language analysis) and in hybrid systems governed by differential\nequations.\n  Our main contribution is a new family of constraint-based abstract domains\nfor abstracting numerical functions, B-bound domains, which abstract a function\nf by a conjunction of bounds from a preselected set of boundary functions. They\nallow inferring highly non-linear numerical invariants, which classical\nnumerical abstract domains struggle with. We uncover a convexity property in\nthe constraint space that simplifies, and, in some cases, fully automates,\ntransfer function design.\n  We also introduce domain abstraction, a functor that lifts arbitrary mappings\nin value space to Galois connections in function space. This supports\nabstraction from symbolic to numerical functions (i.e. size abstraction), and\nenables dimensionality reduction of equations.\n  We base our constructions of transfer functions on a simple operator\nlanguage, starting with sequences, and extending to more general functions,\nincluding multivariate, piecewise, and non-discrete domains."}

Current approaches require extensive manual\nconfiguration, introduce significant boilerplate, and often lack support for\nrecursive calls and object-oriented programming (OOP) constructs-features\ncritical for productive, multi-language development.\n  We present Kernel-FFI, a transparent, language-agnostic framework that\nenables seamless cross-language function calls and object manipulation within\ninteractive notebooks. Kernel-FFI employs source-level transformation to\nautomatically rewrite cross-language invocations, eliminating the need for\nmanual bindings or boilerplate. Kernel-FFI provides robust support for OOP by\nenabling foreign object referencing and automatic resource management across\nlanguage boundaries. Furthermore, to address the blocking nature of Jupyter\nkernels and support recursive and asynchronous foreign calls, we introduce a\nnovel side-channel communication mechanism.

In this work, we propose H2SGEMM,\na high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix\nmultiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI\naccelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and\ncompensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed\nanalysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision\nloss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of\nmantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on\naccuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves\nnumerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes.\nFinally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are\nintroduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling H2SGEMM to\nachieve up to 77% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend\n910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm\nthat our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also\nexhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its\nstructured and error-aware computation order."}

The algorithm relies on a simple threshold-based\nprocedure. A key assumption in [Becchetti et al., SODA 2020] is that the input\ngraph $G$ is static - i.e., both its vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ remain\nunchanged throughout the process - while the analysis of RAES in dynamic models\nis left as a major open question.\n  In this work, we investigate the behavior of RAES under a dynamic graph model\ninduced by a streaming node-churn process (also known as the sliding window\nmodel), where, at each discrete round, a new node joins the graph and the\noldest node departs. This process yields a bounded-degree dynamic graph\n$\\mathcal{G} =\\{ G_t = (V_t, E_t) : t \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ that captures essential\ncharacteristics of peer-to-peer networks -- specifically, node churn and\nthreshold on the number of connections each node can manage. We prove that\nevery snapshot $G_t$ in the dynamic graph sequence has good expansion\nproperties with high probability. Furthermore, we leverage this property to\nestablish a logarithmic upper bound on the completion time of the well-known\nPUSH and PULL rumor spreading protocols over the dynamic graph $\\mathcal{G}$."}

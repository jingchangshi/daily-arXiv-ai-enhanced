Errors arise from various factors, with limited understanding\nof specific failure causes hindering improvement. To address this, we conduct a\ncomprehensive error analysis and manual categorization. Our findings reveal\nthat most errors stem not from LLM reasoning limitations, but from insufficient\nRTL programming knowledge, poor understanding of circuit concepts, ambiguous\ndesign descriptions, or misinterpretation of complex multimodal inputs.\nLeveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted error correction\ntechniques. Specifically, we construct a domain-specific knowledge base and\nemploy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply necessary RTL knowledge.\nTo mitigate ambiguity errors, we introduce design description rules and\nimplement a rule-checking mechanism. For multimodal misinterpretation, we\nintegrate external tools to convert inputs into LLM-compatible meta-formats.\nFor remaining errors, we adopt an iterative debugging loop (simulation-error\nlocalization-correction). Integrating these techniques into an LLM-based\nframework significantly improves performance. We incorporate these error\ncorrection techniques into a foundational LLM-based RTL code generation\nframework, resulting in significantly improved performance. Experimental\nresults show that our enhanced framework achieves 91.0\\% accuracy on the\nVerilogEval benchmark, surpassing the baseline code generation approach by\n32.7\\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our methods."}

Namjoshi", "Thomas Wies"], "title": "Consistent Updates for Scalable Microservices", "comment": null, "summary": "Online services are commonly implemented with a scalable microservice\narchitecture, where isomorphic worker processes service client requests,\nrecording persistent state in a backend data store. To maintain service, any\nmodifications to the service functionality must be made on the fly -- i.e., as\nthe service continues to process client requests -- but doing so is\nchallenging. The central difficulty is that of avoiding potential\ninconsistencies caused by ''mixed mode'' operation, where workers of current\nand new versions are concurrently active and interact via the data store. Some\nupdate methods avoid mixed mode altogether, but only at the cost of substantial\ninefficiency -- by doubling resources (memory and compute), or by halving\nthroughput. The alternative is a so-called ''rolling'' update, which is\nuncontrolled and runs the risk of serious service failures arising from\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior.\n  In this paper, we present the first algorithms that guarantee consistency for\nmixed mode updates. The algorithms rely on semantic properties of service\nactions, such as commutativity. We show that semantic awareness is required, by\nproving that any semantically oblivious, mixed-mode update method cannot avoid\ninconsistencies. Ideally, it should appear to every client that a service\nupdate takes effect atomically; this ensures that a client is not exposed to\ninconsistent mixed-mode behavior. We introduce a framework that formalizes this\nintuition and develop foundational theory for reasoning about the consistency\nof mixed-mode updates, applying that theory to derive the new algorithms and\nestablish their correctness."}

This is known as Sender/Receiver (S/R, for\nshort) communication model. The robots can move with max speed $1$. The moving\ntarget starts at distance $d$ from the origin and can move either with speed\n$v<1$ away from the origin in the ``away'' model or with speed $v \\geq 0$\ntoward the origin in the ``toward'' model. We assume that the direction of\nmotion of the target (i.e., whether it is the away or toward model) is known to\nthe robots in advance. To capture the target the two robots must be co-located\nwith it.\n  We design new linear search algorithms and analyze the competitive ratio of\nthe time required to capture the target.

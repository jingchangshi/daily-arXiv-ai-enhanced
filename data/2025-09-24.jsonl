Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus\non low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability\nand offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation\npipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for\ncompiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second\nquantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum\nparticle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety\nand correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and\nenforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both\ndigital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics,\nfrom static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue,\nincluding its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are\nfully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end\nverified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation."}

The release of the MILK-V Pioneer marked\na significant milestone as the first desktop-grade RISC-V system.

Despite its capabilities, there\nremains a lack of systematic evaluation regarding the feasibility and\nperformance prediction accuracy of FireSim when compared to physical hardware.\n  In this study, we address this gap by modeling a commercially available\nsingle-board computer and a desktop-grade RISC-V CPU within FireSim. To ensure\nfidelity between simulation and real hardware, we first measure the performance\nof a series of benchmarks to compare runtime behavior under single-core and\nfour-core configurations. Based on the closest matching simulation parameters,\nwe subsequently evaluate performance using a representative mini-application\nand the LAMMPS molecular dynamics code.\n  Our findings indicate that while FireSim provides valuable insights into\narchitectural performance trends, discrepancies remain between simulated and\nmeasured runtimes. These deviations stem from both inherent limitations of the\nsimulation environment and the restricted availability of detailed performance\nspecifications from CPU manufacturers, which hinder precise configuration\nmatching."}

Monolithic SoC designs struggle\nwith this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at\nadvanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based\nRISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI\nacceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design\nintegrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer:\nadaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware\nUniversal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring\nstreaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed\ncryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent\nsensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V\nCPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory\nstacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across\nindustry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video\nprocessing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized\nconfiguration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement,\nand 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations.\nThese improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain\ncorresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while\nmaintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads.\nThese performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve\nnear-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency,\nscalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device\napplications."}

GRF replaces dense pilots with a\nsparse Gaussian field, cutting pilot overhead by about 100x while delivering\n1.1 ms inference and less than 2 minutes on-site training, thus enabling\nmillisecond-scale closed-loop operation. A replay-driven continual learner\nsustains accuracy under mobility and cell transitions, improving channel\nnormalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 10 dB over frozen predictors\nand an additional 2-5 dB over uniform replay, thereby stabilizing performance\nacross UMi/UMa handovers. Finally, minPMAC solves a convex, order-free MAC\nprecoder design that recovers the globally optimal order from Broadcast Channel\n(BC) duals and minimizes transmit energy subject to minimum-rate guarantees,\nachieving 4-10 times lower energy (scenario dependent) with monotonically\nincreasing bits per joule as SNR grows. This translates to up to 5 times higher\ndata rate at comparable power or the same rates at substantially lower power.\nTogether, these components form a practical, GPU-ready framework that attains\nreal-time CSI, robust tracking in dynamic networks with efficient handovers,\nand state-of-the-art throughput-energy tradeoffs under 3GPP-style settings."}

The\nreliance on static peak memory estimates exacerbates fragmentation,\nunderutilization, and job rejections. We propose Scheduler-Driven Job\nAtomization (SJA), a new paradigm that establishes a bidirectional interaction\nbetween scheduler and jobs. In SJA, the scheduler advertises available\nexecution gaps, and jobs respond by signaling interest if they can potentially\ngenerate a subjob that fits the offered time-capacity window. The scheduler may\ncollect multiple signals for the same slot and, based on its allocation policy\n(e.g., fairness, efficiency, or SLA priorities), selects which job is granted\nthe slot. Only then does the chosen job materialize a safe, self-contained\nsubjob tailored to that opportunity. Unlike migration or preemption, SJA\nproactively shapes workloads before execution, thereby avoiding costly state\ntransfers and unpredictable interruptions. It aims to increase GPU utilization,\nreduce wait times, and minimize migration overhead by aligning jobs with\nopportunities in real time, ensuring that each admitted subjob is correct by\nconstruction. This paper is presented as a concept paper: it introduces the\nparadigm, defines its building blocks, and outlines future research directions,\nrather than offering a full experimental evaluation."}

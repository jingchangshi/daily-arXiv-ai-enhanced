Large configuration search space and cloud uncertainties are often mitigated using contextual bandit techniques for resource orchestration including the state-of-the-art Drone orchestrator.

We investigate the efficient scheduling of transactions in a network of fog-cloud computing model, where transactions and their associated shared objects can move within the network.

Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \\cdot \\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation.

Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios.

Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains.

Our framework provides an input language of recurrences over logical tensors, which then gets lowered into an intermediate language of recurrences over logical iteration spaces, and finally into programs of send, receive, and computation operations specific to each individual processor. In Cyclotron's IR, programs are optimized such that external memory interactions are confined to the boundaries of the iteration space. Within inner iteration spaces, all data accesses become local: data accesses target values residing in local fast memory or on neighboring processing units, avoiding costly memory movement. We provide a scheduling language allowing users to define how data gets streamed and broadcasted between processors, enabling pipelined execution of computation kernels over distributed topologies of processing elements. We demonstrate the portability of our approach by compiling our IR to a reconfigurable simulator of systolic arrays and chiplet style distributed hardware, as well as to distributed-memory CPU clusters. In the simulated reconfigurable setting, we use our compiler for hardware design space exploration in which link costs and latencies can be specified. In the distributed CPU setting, we show how to use recurrences and our scheduling language to express various matrix multiplication routines (Cannon, SUMMA, PUMMA, weight stationary) and solvers (Triangular solve and Cholesky).

The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively.

This makes inference predictable and efficient. Unfortunately, many extensions of ML (GADTs, higher-rank polymorphism, and static overloading) endanger princpality by introducing _fragile_ constructs that resist principal inference. Existing approaches recover principality through directional inference algorithms, which propagate _known_ type information in a fixed (or static) order (e.g. as in bidirectional typing) to disambiguate such constructs. However, the rigidity of a static inference order often causes otherwise well-typed programs to be rejected.\n  We propose _omnidirectional_ type inference, where type information flows in a dynamic order. Typing constraints may be solved in any order, suspending when progress requires known type information and resuming once it becomes available, using _suspended match constraints_. This approach is straightforward for simply typed systems, but extending it to ML is challenging due to let-generalization. Existing ML inference algorithms type let-bindings (let x = e1 in e2) in a fixed order: type e1, generalize its type, and then type e2. To overcome this, we introduce _incremental instantiation_, allowing partially solved type schemes containing suspended constraints to be instantiated, with a mechanism to incrementally update instances as the scheme is refined.\n  Omnidirectionality provides a general framework for restoring principality in the presence of fragile features. We demonstrate its versatility on two fundamentally different features of OCaml: static overloading of record labels and datatype constructors and semi-explicit first-class polymorphism. In both cases, we obtain a principal type inference algorithm that is more expressive than OCaml's current typechecker.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5168\u5411\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u6302\u8d77\u5339\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3ML\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "ML\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5982GADTs\u3001\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u6001\u3001\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u8f7d\uff09\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u53d8\u5f97\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u62d2\u7edd\u672c\u5e94\u7c7b\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5168\u5411\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u987a\u5e8f\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6302\u8d77\u5339\u914d\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5df2\u77e5\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6682\u505c\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5904\u7406let\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OCaml\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u6027\uff08\u8bb0\u5f55\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u5668\u7684\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u8f7d\u3001\u534a\u663e\u5f0f\u4e00\u7b49\u591a\u6001\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4OCaml\u5f53\u524d\u7c7b\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u5411\u6027\u4e3a\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u7279\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406ML\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6269\u5c55\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules.

This paper proposes a lightweight server-selection method for edge applications that fuses latency prediction with adaptive reliability and hysteresis-based handover. Using passive measurements (arrival rate, utilization, payload size) and an exponentially modulated rational delay model, the proposed Moderate Handover (MO-HAN) method computes a score that balances predicted latency and reliability to ensure handovers occur only when the expected gain is meaningful and maintain reduced end-to-end latency. Results show that MO-HAN consistently outperforms static and fair-distribution baselines by lowering mean and tail latencies, while reducing handovers by nearly 50% compared to pure opportunistic selection.

However, under the lens of non-strict evaluation, linearity can be further understood semantically, where a syntactic occurrence of a resource does not necessarily entail using that resource when the program is executed. While this distinction has been largely unexplored, it turns out to be inescapable in Haskell's optimising compiler, which heavily rewrites the source program in ways that break syntactic linearity but preserve the program's semantics. We introduce Linear Core, a novel system which accepts the lazy semantics of linearity statically and is suitable for lazy languages such as the Core intermediate language of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. We prove that Linear Core is sound, guaranteeing linear resource usage, and that multiple optimising transformations preserve linearity in Linear Core while failing to do so in Core.

As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed.

CuTe layouts and Triton linear layouts are widely adopted industry standards. However, these layout systems operate independently with distinct mathematical underpinnings, preventing unified formal analysis and cross-system reasoning. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel approach that leverages the Integer Set Library (ISL) to create a unified mathematical representation for both layout systems through integer set relations, thereby enabling rigorous formal analysis, correctness verification, and the foundation for future cross-system optimization strategies. Our approach models CuTe layouts through integer set relations that encode the transformation from multi-dimensional coordinates to linear indices using stride-based calculations, including sophisticated swizzle operations that perform bit-level manipulations for enhanced memory access patterns. For Triton linear layouts, we construct integer set relations that model the binary vector space transformations where arithmetic operations follow finite field F_2 rules. We implement a complete suite of layout manipulation algorithms for composition, inversion, complement using built-in operations in ISL to ensure mathematical correctness and preserve layout semantics. Experimental evaluation shows that the system handles the full spectrum of layout complexity, from elementary identity transformations to sophisticated multi-dimensional tensor arrangements with complex stride configurations and swizzle patterns, validating the mathematical modeling approach across different layout paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u6570\u96c6\u5e93(ISL)\u4e3aCuTe\u5e03\u5c40\u548cTriton\u7ebf\u6027\u5e03\u5c40\u521b\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u96c6\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e03\u5c40\u62bd\u8c61\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u5f20\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5185\u5b58\u5b89\u6392\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6620\u5c04\u3002CuTe\u5e03\u5c40\u548cTriton\u7ebf\u6027\u5e03\u5c40\u662f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5404\u81ea\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6574\u6570\u96c6\u5e93(ISL)\u5efa\u6a21\uff1a\u5bf9CuTe\u5e03\u5c40\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u96c6\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u4ece\u591a\u7ef4\u5750\u6807\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6b65\u957f\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4f4d\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684swizzle\u64cd\u4f5c\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9Triton\u7ebf\u6027\u5e03\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7b97\u672f\u8fd0\u7b97\u9075\u5faa\u6709\u9650\u57dfF_2\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5957\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u57fa\u672c\u6052\u7b49\u53d8\u6362\u5230\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u6b65\u957f\u914d\u7f6e\u548cswizzle\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5f20\u91cf\u5b89\u6392\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5e03\u5c40\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8c31\u7cfb\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u5e03\u5c40\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u6865\u63a5\u4e86CuTe\u548cTriton\u5e03\u5c40\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency.

Such modeling is essential for pre-deployment system-level optimizations (e.g., parallelization strategies) and design-space explorations. While recent efforts have proposed collecting execution traces from real systems, access to large-scale infrastructure remains limited to major cloud providers. Moreover, traces obtained from existing platforms cannot be easily adapted to study future larger-scale system configurations. We introduce Symbolic Tensor grAph GEnerator(STAGE), a framework that synthesizes high-fidelity execution traces to accurately model LLM workloads. STAGE supports a comprehensive set of parallelization strategies, allowing users to systematically explore a wide spectrum of LLM architectures and system configurations. STAGE demonstrates its scalability by synthesizing high-fidelity LLM traces spanning over 32K GPUs, while preserving tensor-level accuracy in compute, memory, and communication. STAGE will be publicly available to facilitate further research in distributed machine learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAGE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u53f7\u5f20\u91cf\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5668(STAGE)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u5404\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "STAGE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u8d85\u8fc732K GPU\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLLM\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "STAGE\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

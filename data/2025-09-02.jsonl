We present SCE-NTT, a dedicated hardware accelerator based on\nsuperconductive single flux quantum (SFQ) logic and memory, targeting high\nperformance and energy efficiency beyond the limits of conventional CMOS. To\naddress SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout,\nwe propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory\n(SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7\nprocessing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual\ncoefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and\ntwiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized\nfor a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell\nlibrary with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was\ndeveloped for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated\nusing JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme\nwas employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead,\nimproving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit\nachieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art\nCMOS equivalents.

FL can be categorized into centralized and\ndecentralized paradigms. The centralized paradigm relies on a central server to\naggregate local models, potentially resulting in single points of failure,\ncommunication bottlenecks, and exposure of model parameters. In contrast, the\ndecentralized paradigm, which does not require a central server, provides\nimproved robustness and privacy. The essence of federated learning lies in\nleveraging multiple local updates for efficient communication. However, this\napproach may result in slower convergence or even convergence to suboptimal\nmodels in the presence of heterogeneous and imbalanced data. To address this\nchallenge, we study decentralized federated averaging via random walk (DFedRW),\nwhich replaces multiple local update steps on a single device with random walk\nupdates. Traditional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and its decentralized\nversions commonly ignore stragglers, which reduces the amount of training data\nand introduces sampling bias. Therefore, we allow DFedRW to aggregate partial\nrandom walk updates, ensuring that each computation contributes to the model\nupdate. To further improve communication efficiency, we also propose a\nquantized version of DFedRW. We demonstrate that (quantized) DFedRW achieves\nconvergence upper bound of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{k^{1-q}})$ under convex\nconditions.

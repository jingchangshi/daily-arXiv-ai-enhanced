Although PyTorch 2 introduced TorchDynamo and\nTorchInductor to enable just-in-time graph compilation, unresolved dynamic\ncontrol flow and unsupported Python constructs often fragment models into\nmultiple FX graphs. These fragments force frequent fallbacks to eager mode,\nincur costly CPU-to-GPU synchronizations, and reduce optimization\nopportunities. GraphMend addresses this limitation by analyzing and\ntransforming source code before execution. Built on the Jac compilation\nframework, GraphMend introduces two code transformations that remove graph\nbreaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions. This design allows\nPyTorch's compilation pipeline to capture larger, uninterrupted FX graphs\nwithout requiring manual refactoring by developers. Evaluation across eight\nHugging Face models shows that GraphMend removes all fixable graph breaks due\nto dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions, driving the break count to 0\nin 6 models and reducing it from 5 to 2 in another model. On NVIDIA RTX 3090\nand A40 GPUs, GraphMend achieves up to 75% latency reductions and up to 8%\nhigher end-to-end throughput. These results demonstrate that high-level code\ntransformation is an effective complement to PyTorch's dynamic JIT compilation\npipeline, substantially improving both usability and performance."}

However, as clients perform\nself-supervised training on heterogeneous data, local models may diverge\nsemantically. To mitigate this, TACTFL incorporates a similarity-guided model\naggregation strategy that dynamically weights client models based on their\nrepresentational consistency, promoting global alignment. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse benchmarks and modalities, including video, audio, and wearable\nsensors, demonstrate that TACTFL achieves state-of-the-art performance. For\ninstance, on the UCF101 dataset with only 10% labelled data, TACTFL attains\n68.48% top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming the FedOpt baseline of\n35.35%. Code will be released upon publication."}

Since\nthe inference system is divided into two stage with different characteristics:\nPrefill and Decode, the two stage will interfere with each other during the\ninference process. Toward this end, a P-D disaggregated inference framework is\nproposed by some researchers. Current research is done on homogeneous GPUs, and\nlacks deployment solutions based on business scenarios. Compared with\nhomogeneous GPUs, using heterogeneous GPUs to construct inference systems can\nbetter improve resource utilization and reduce costs. Even if GPUs from\ndifferent vendors are used to build inference systems, on the basis of reducing\ncosts, the resource utilization rate can be improved and the dependence on a\nsingle vendor can be reduced. Therefore, a P-D disaggreagetd inference system\nbased on heterogeneous GPUs is designed, and the heterogeneous compatible\ntransmission module in the system is designed to address heterogeneous GPU data\ncompatibility issues. Then, a joint optimization algorithm of parallel strategy\nand instance number allocation is proposed to obtain the deployment solutions.\nFinally, the experimental results show that the P-D disaggregated inference\nsystem can well solve the hybrid inference problem of heterogeneous GPUs from\ndifferent vendors, and the joint optimization algorithm can obtain the optimal\ndeployment solution."}

Specifically, we adapt a simple median rule from the\nstabilizing consensus problem [Doerr11] to operate in a client-server setting\nwhere arbitrary servers may be blocked adaptively based on past system\ninformation. We further extend our protocol by compressing information about\ncommitted commands, thus keeping the protocol lightweight, while still enabling\nclients to easily prove that their commands have indeed been committed on the\nshared state. Our approach guarantees liveness as long as at most a constant\nfraction of servers are blocked, ensures safety under any number of blocked\nservers, and supports fast recovery from massive blocking attacks. In addition\nto offering near-optimal performance in several respects, our method is fully\ndecentralized, unlike other near-optimal solutions that rely on leaders. In\nparticular, our solution is robust against adversaries that target key servers\n(which captures insider-based denial-of-service attacks), whereas leader-based\napproaches fail under such a blocking model."}

Yet, while containers simplify software management, they face\nsignificant performance challenges in HPC environments as they must sacrifice\nhardware-specific optimizations to achieve portability. Although HPC containers\ncan use runtime hooks to access optimized MPI libraries and GPU devices, they\nare limited by application binary interface (ABI) compatibility and cannot\novercome the effects of early-stage compilation decisions. Acceleration as a\nService (XaaS) proposes a vision of performance-portable containers, where a\ncontainerized application should achieve peak performance across all HPC\nsystems. We present a practical realization of this vision through Source and\nIntermediate Representation (IR) containers, where we delay\nperformance-critical decisions until the target system specification is known.\nWe analyze specialization mechanisms in HPC software and propose a new\nLLM-assisted method for automatic discovery of specializations. By examining\nthe compilation pipeline, we develop a methodology to build containers\noptimized for target architectures at deployment time. Our prototype\ndemonstrates that new XaaS containers combine the convenience of\ncontainerization with the performance benefits of system-specialized builds."}

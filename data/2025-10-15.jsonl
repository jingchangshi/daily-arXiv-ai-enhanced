While these arguments are intuitive,\nthey have not all been foolproof, and whether they directly correspond to\nformal proofs is in question. We formally ground this kind of reasoning and\nconnect it to standard formal approaches through language design and\nmeta-analysis, which leads to a functional style of compositional formal\nreasoning for a class of distributed systems, including cases involving\nByzantine faults. The core of our approach is twin languages: Sync and Async,\nwhich formalize the insight from distributed system theory that an asynchronous\nsystem can be reduced to a synchronous system for more straightforward\nreasoning under certain conditions. Sync describes a distributed system as a\nsingle, synchronous, data-parallel program. It restricts programs syntactically\nand has a functional denotational semantics suitable for Hoare-style formal\nreasoning. Async models a distributed system as a collection of interacting\nmonadic programs, one for each non-faulty node in the system. It has a standard\ntrace-based operational semantics, modeling asynchrony with interleaving. Sync\ncompiles to Async and can then be extracted to yield executable code. We prove\nthat any safety property proven for a Sync program in its denotational\nsemantics is preserved in the operational semantics of its compiled Async\nprograms. We implement the twin languages in Rocq and verify the safety\nproperties of two fault-tolerant consensus protocols: BOSCO and SeqPaxos."}

Descriptor-based\ndirect memory access controllers (DMACs) allow such transfers to be executed by\ndecoupling memory transfers from processing units. Classical descriptor-based\nDMACs are inefficient when handling arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes.\nExcessive descriptor size and the serialized nature of processing descriptors\nemployed by the DMAC lead to large static overheads when setting up transfers.\nTo tackle this inefficiency, we propose a descriptor-based DMAC optimized to\nefficiently handle arbitrary transfers of small unit sizes. We implement a\nlightweight descriptor format in an AXI4-based DMAC. We further increase\nperformance by implementing a low-overhead speculative descriptor prefetching\nscheme without additional latency penalties in the case of a misprediction. Our\nDMAC is integrated into a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V SoC and emulated on a\nKintex FPGA to evaluate its performance. Compared to an off-the-shelf\ndescriptor-based DMAC IP, we achieve 1.66x less latency launching transfers,\nincrease bus utilization up to 2.5x in an ideal memory system with\n64-byte-length transfers while requiring 11% fewer lookup tables, 23% fewer\nflip-flops, and no block RAMs. We can extend our lead in bus utilization to\n3.6x with 64-byte-length transfers in deep memory systems.

We propose Metronome, a network-aware and priority-aware\nscheduling mechanism for cloud native networks. This mechanism is designed to\nsupport jobs that exhibit periodic traffic patterns and dynamic bandwidth\ndemands, particularly in the context of distributed training. Specifically,\nMetronome employs a time-division multiplexing approach that leverages job\ntraffic characteristics to construct an elastic network resource allocation\nmodel, enabling efficient bandwidth sharing across multiple jobs. In addition,\nit incorporates a multi-objective optimization strategy, jointly considering\nlatency and job priorities to achieve globally optimal as well as dynamic\nresource allocation. Finally, Metronome adapts to the dynamic environment by\nmonitoring the cluster and performing reconfiguration operations. Extensive\nexperiments with 13 common machine learning models demonstrate that Metronome\ncan enhance cluster resource utilization while guaranteeing service\nperformance.

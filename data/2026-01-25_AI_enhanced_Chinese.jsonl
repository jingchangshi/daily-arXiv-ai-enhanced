FlexLLM exposes key architectural degrees of freedom for stage-customized inference, enabling hybrid designs that tailor temporal reuse and spatial dataflow differently for prefill and decode, and provides a comprehensive quantization suite to support accurate low-bit deployment. Using FlexLLM, we build a complete inference system for the Llama-3.2 1B model in under two months with only 1K lines of code. The system includes: (1) a stage-customized accelerator with hardware-efficient quantization (12.68 WikiText-2 PPL) surpassing SpinQuant baseline, and (2) a Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT) plug-in for efficient long-context processing. On the AMD U280 FPGA at 16nm, the accelerator achieves 1.29$\\times$ end-to-end speedup, 1.64$\\times$ higher decode throughput, and 3.14$\\times$ better energy efficiency than an NVIDIA A100 GPU (7nm) running BF16 inference; projected results on the V80 FPGA at 7nm reach 4.71$\\times$, 6.55$\\times$, and 4.13$\\times$, respectively. In long-context scenarios, integrating the HMT plug-in reduces prefill latency by 23.23$\\times$ and extends the context window by 64$\\times$, delivering 1.10$\\times$/4.86$\\times$ lower end-to-end latency and 5.21$\\times$/6.27$\\times$ higher energy efficiency on the U280/V80 compared to the A100 baseline.

SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u4ece\u56fe\u62bd\u8c61\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fb9\u5171\u6210\u5458\u5173\u7cfb\u6355\u6349\u6838\u5fc3\u5185\u5c16\u5cf0\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06SNN\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2aNP-hard\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5c06SNN\u56fe\u5206\u533a\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u5206\u533a\u653e\u7f6e\u5230\u786c\u4ef6\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u3002\u968f\u7740SNN\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u5230\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06SNN\u4ece\u56fe\u62bd\u8c61\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u8fb9\u5171\u6210\u5458\u5173\u7cfb\u6355\u6349\u6838\u5fc3\u5185\u5c16\u5cf0\u590d\u5236\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fb9\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6620\u5c04\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8d85\u8fb9\u5206\u7ec4\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u533a\u548c\u653e\u7f6e\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u548c\u6587\u732e\u6539\u7f16\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u8d85\u56fe\u57fa\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u90fd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8d85\u8fb9\u91cd\u53e0\u6027\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u56fe\u62bd\u8c61\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21SNN\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fb9\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6620\u5c04\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6620\u5c04\u3002"}}

This paper presents an industry case study of an open-source, multi-tenant platform that enables small businesses to deploy customised LLM-based support chatbots via a no-code workflow. The platform is built on distributed, lightweight k3s clusters spanning heterogeneous, low-cost machines and interconnected through an encrypted overlay network, enabling cost-efficient resource pooling while enforcing container-based isolation and per-tenant data access controls. In addition, the platform integrates practical, platform-level defences against prompt injection attacks in RAG-based chatbots, translating insights from recent prompt injection research into deployable security mechanisms without requiring model retraining or enterprise-scale infrastructure. We evaluate the proposed platform through a real-world e-commerce deployment, demonstrating that secure and efficient LLM-based chatbot services can be achieved under realistic cost, operational, and security constraints faced by small businesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u7684\u591a\u79df\u6237\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9a\u5236\u7684LLM\u652f\u6301\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u5927\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728RAG\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff09\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7k3s\u96c6\u7fa4\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u591a\u79df\u6237\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u673a\u5668\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5bc6\u8986\u76d6\u7f51\u7edc\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6c60\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bb9\u5668\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u79df\u6237\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5e73\u53f0\u8fd8\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9RAG\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u73b0\u5b9e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528LLM\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684Rust\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u914d\u7f6e", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fRust\uff09\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u914d\u7f6e\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u4f7f\u5f97\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "1) \u4eceRust\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b4) \u6839\u636e\u4ee3\u7801\u5f71\u54cd\u8303\u56f4\u7ec6\u5316\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528SAT\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4fdd\u8bc1\u914d\u7f6e\u6709\u6548\u6027", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177RustyEx\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90Rust\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6307\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6784\u9020\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u914d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Experimental evaluation using the Lennard-Jones FRNN interaction model as a case study shows that the proposed update/rebuild ratio optimizer is capable of adapting to the different dynamics that emerge during a simulation, leading to a RT core pipeline up to $\\sim 3.4\\times$ faster than with other known approaches to manage the BVH. In terms of simulation step performance, the proposed variants can significantly improve the speedup and EE of the base RT core idea; from $\\sim1.3\\times$ at small radius to $\\sim2.0\\times$ for log normal radius distributions. Furthermore, the proposed variants manage to simulate cases that would otherwise not fit in memory because of the use of neighbor lists, such as clusters of particles with log normal radius distribution. The proposed RT Core technique to support periodic BC is indeed effective as it does not introduce any significant penalty in performance. In terms of scaling, the proposed methods scale both their performance and EE across GPU generations.

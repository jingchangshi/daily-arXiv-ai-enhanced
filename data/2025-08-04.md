Abstract: A core challenge in program synthesis is taming the large space of possible
programs. Since program synthesis is essentially a combinatorial search, the
community has sought to leverage powerful combinatorial constraint solvers.
Here, constraints are used to express the program semantics, but not as a
potentially potent tool to remove unwanted programs. Recent inductive logic
programming approaches introduce constraints on the program's syntax to be
synthesized. These syntactic constraints allow for checking and propagating a
constraint without executing the program, and thus for arbitrary operators. In
this work, we leverage syntactic constraints to model program spaces, defining
not just solutions that are feasible, but also ones that are likely useful. To
demonstrate this idea, we introduce BART, a solver that efficiently propagates
and solves these constraints. We evaluate BART on program space enumeration
tasks, finding that the constraints eliminate up to 99 percent of the program
space, and that modeling program spaces significantly reduces enumeration time.

Abstract: Program synthesis--the automated generation of executable code from
high-level specifications--has been a central goal of computer science for over
fifty years. This thesis provides a comparative literature review of the main
paradigms that have shaped the field, tracing its evolution from formal logic
based methods to recent advances using large scale neural models. We examine
five key approaches: logic based (deductive) synthesis, inductive (example
based) synthesis, sketch/schema based synthesis, large language model based
synthesis, and neuro-symbolic hybrids. For each, we analyze foundational
principles, notable systems, and practical applications, highlighting trade
offs between correctness guarantees, specification requirements, search
complexity, and expressive power. By reviewing developments from formally
verified synthesis tools such as KIDS and Coq to data driven models generating
probabilistic code from natural language like Codex, we present a comprehensive
narrative of progress and ongoing challenges. This work emphasizes the
transition from symbolic to hybrid neuro-symbolic methods and outlines future
directions for reliable and scalable program synthesis.

### [4] [Automated Type Annotation in Python Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00422)
*Varun Bharti,Shashwat Jha,Dhruv Kumar,Pankaj Jalote*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 使用LLMs生成Python类型注释，通过生成-检查-修复流程提高一致性和准确性，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成Python类型注释易出错且耗时，传统自动化方法存在局限性，探索LLMs的潜力。

Method: 开发生成-检查-修复流程，利用LLMs提出注释，静态检查器验证并迭代修正。

Result: GPT 4.1mini和O3Mini表现最佳，一致性达88.6%，准确率最高70.5%。

Conclusion: 无需微调的LLMs能有效生成类型注释，性能媲美传统深度学习，适用于其他可选类型语言。

Abstract: Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection.
However, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires
extra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine
learning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral
over approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we
explore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a
generate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a
Concrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies
them, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four
LLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini
(reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark.
We first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which
MyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved
consistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini,
and O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4%
failures). To measure annotation quality, we then compute exact-match and
base-type match accuracies over all 6000 snippets: GPT 4.1mini and O3Mini
perform the best, achieving up to 70.5% exact match and 79.1% base type
accuracy, requiring under one repair iteration on average. Our results
demonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task
specific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating
consistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep
learning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training. While our
work focuses on Python, the pipeline can be extended to other optionally typed
imperative languages like Ruby

variables, base types, set-theoretic types and map types. Syntax of map types
spans all the map types available in Erlang. The model of types is used to
define a semantic subtyping relation based on set containment. The novelty of
this work is the definition of subtyping over parameteric map types.

### [6] [Towards a unified framework for programming paradigms: A systematic review of classification formalisms and methodological foundations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00534)
*Mikel Vandeloise*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述（SLR）探讨了多范式语言的兴起对传统分类方法的挑战，并提出了一种基于数学框架的重构方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多范式语言的兴起导致传统分类方法无法应对，引发了互操作性缺陷等实际问题。

Method: 基于74项主要研究的综合分析，评估现有分类形式的局限性，并探索基于类型理论、范畴论和统一编程理论（UTP）的重构方法。

Result: 研究发现现有分类缺乏概念粒度、统一的形式基础，并难以应对混合语言。重构方法通过正交原子原语和数学框架解决了这些问题。

Conclusion: 文献反映了从分类向重构框架的显著转变，本文提出了统一这些框架的研究议程。

Abstract: The rise of multi-paradigm languages challenges traditional classification
methods, leading to practical software engineering issues like interoperability
defects. This systematic literature review (SLR) maps the formal foundations of
programming paradigms. Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the
art of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the
conceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful,
reconstructive approach.
  Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies
lack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid
languages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a
compositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal
set of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks,
predominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming
(UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties.
  We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift
away from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive
frameworks. This review provides a map of this evolution and proposes a
research agenda for their unification.

### [7] [Integrated user scheduling and beam steering in over-the-air federated learning for mobile IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00341)

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合空中计算和联邦学习的框架，通过用户调度和接收波束成形优化通信效率和推理准确性，并提出了低复杂度的用户调度策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网（IoT）的普及带来了隐私问题，联邦学习（FL）作为一种去中心化训练方法被提出，但大规模网络中的资源稀缺性限制了其效率。

Method: 引入空中计算到FL框架，提出用户调度和接收波束成形的集成方法，并通过差分凸技术分解非凸优化问题。进一步提出低复杂度用户调度策略。

Result: 实验验证了所提方法在聚合误差和学习性能上的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了资源稀缺下的FL效率问题，并提供了低复杂度的实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rising popularity of Internet of things (IoT) has spurred technological
advancements in mobile internet and interconnected systems. While offering
flexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, IoT
service providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which
nonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. Federated
learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to
tackle this challenge. This work focuses on enhancing the aggregation
efficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation
into the FL framework. Due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks,
only a subset of users can participate in each training round. This highlights
the need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to
optimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. To address this, we
propose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering,
subject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power.
Leveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal
non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative
solution. While effective, the computational load of the iterative method
hampers its practical implementation. To overcome this, we further propose a
low-complexity user scheduling policy based on characteristic analysis of the
wireless channel to directly determine the user subset without iteration.
Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms
of aggregation error and learning performance over existing approaches.

### [8] [Tetris: Efficient Intra-Datacenter Calls Packing for Large Conferencing Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00426)
*Rohan Gandhi,Ankur Mallick,Ken Sueda,Rui Liang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出Tetris框架，通过优化初始呼叫分配和定期迁移热MP上的呼叫，显著减少热MP的使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有会议服务（如Teams）的呼叫分配算法容易导致部分MP过热，影响性能并增加成本。

Method: Tetris框架结合历史数据优化初始分配，并利用线性优化定期迁移热MP上的呼叫。

Result: 在包含1000万次呼叫的24小时追踪中，Tetris将热MP上的参与者数量减少至少2.5倍。

Conclusion: Tetris有效解决了MP过热问题，提升了性能并降低了成本。

Abstract: Conference services like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet facilitate
millions of daily calls, yet ensuring high performance at low costs remains a
significant challenge. This paper revisits the problem of packing calls across
Media Processor (MP) servers that host the calls within individual datacenters
(DCs). We show that the algorithm used in Teams -- a large scale conferencing
service as well as other state-of-art algorithms are prone to placing calls
resulting in some of the MPs becoming hot (high CPU utilization) that leads to
degraded performance and/or elevated hosting costs. The problem arises from
disregarding the variability in CPU usage among calls, influenced by
differences in participant numbers and media types (audio/video), compounded by
bursty call arrivals. To tackle this, we propose Tetris, a multi-step framework
which (a) optimizes initial call assignments by leveraging historical data and
(b) periodically migrates calls from hot MPs using linear optimization, aiming
to minimize hot MP usage. Evaluation based on a 24-hour trace of over 10
million calls in one DC shows that Tetris reduces participant numbers on hot
MPs by at least 2.5X.

### [9] [SwarnRaft: Leveraging Consensus for Robust Drone Swarm Coordination in GNSS-Degraded Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00622)
*Kapel Dev,Yash Madhwal,Sofia Shevelo,Pavel Osinenko,Yury Yanovich*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SwarnRaft是一个基于区块链启发的框架，用于在GNSS信号缺失时维持无人机群的协调和数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机群在关键应用中依赖GNSS信号，但信号可能因干扰或攻击中断，导致任务失败。

Method: 利用Raft共识算法，使无人机在GNSS信号缺失时仍能就状态更新达成一致。

Result: 原型系统在模拟群中展示了轻量级、可扩展的通信模型，保持了群的一致性和容错性。

Conclusion: SwarnRaft为不可预测环境中的去中心化无人机操作提供了实用且安全的基础。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly used in critical
applications such as aerial mapping, environmental monitoring, and autonomous
delivery. However, the reliability of these systems is highly dependent on
uninterrupted access to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals,
which can be disrupted in real-world scenarios due to interference,
environmental conditions, or adversarial attacks, causing disorientation,
collision risks, and mission failure. This paper proposes SwarnRaft, a
blockchain-inspired positioning and consensus framework for maintaining
coordination and data integrity in UAV swarms operating under GNSS-denied
conditions. SwarnRaft leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to enable
distributed drones (nodes) to agree on state updates such as location and
heading, even in the absence of GNSS signals for one or more nodes. In our
prototype, each node uses GNSS and local sensing, and communicates over WiFi in
a simulated swarm. Upon signal loss, consensus is used to reconstruct or verify
the position of the failed node based on its last known state and trajectory.
Our system demonstrates robustness in maintaining swarm coherence and fault
tolerance through a lightweight, scalable communication model. This work offers
a practical and secure foundation for decentralized drone operation in
unpredictable environments.

The accelerator addresses fundamental challenges of on-device learning (ODL) for resource-constrained edge applications through two synergistic modules: a parameter-efficient feature extractor employing weight clustering and an FSL classifier based on hyperdimensional computing (HDC). The feature extractor exploits the weight clustering mechanism to reduce computational complexity, while the HDC-based FSL classifier eliminates gradient-based back propagation operations, enabling single-pass training with substantially reduced latency. Additionally, FSL-HDnn enables low-latency ODL and inference via two proposed optimization strategies, including an early-exit mechanism with branch feature extraction and batched single-pass training that improves hardware utilization. Measurement results demonstrate that our chip fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS process delivers superior training energy efficiency of 6 mJ/image and end-to-end training throughput of 28 images/s on a 10-way 5-shot FSL task. The end-to-end training latency is also reduced by 2x to 20.9x compared to state-of-the-art ODL chips."}

However, different applications place diverse and sometimes diverging demands on power, performance, and area that cannot be universally satisfied with fixed commodity DRAM designs. Die stacking creates the opportunity for a large DRAM design space through 3D integration and expanded total die area. To open and navigate this expansive design space of customized memory architectures that cater to application-specific needs, we introduce DreamRAM, a configurable bandwidth, capacity, energy, latency, and area modeling tool for custom 3D die-stacked DRAM designs. DreamRAM exposes fine-grained design customization parameters at the MAT, subarray, bank, and inter-bank levels, including extensions of partial page and subarray parallelism proposals found in the literature, to open a large previously-unexplored design space. DreamRAM analytically models wire pitch, width, length, capacitance, and scaling parameters to capture the performance tradeoffs of physical layout and routing design choices. Routing awareness enables DreamRAM to model a custom MAT-level routing scheme, Dataline-Over-MAT (DLOMAT), to facilitate better bandwidth tradeoffs. DreamRAM is calibrated and validated against published industry HBM3 and HBM2E designs. Within DreamRAM's rich design space, we identify designs that achieve each of 66% higher bandwidth, 100% higher capacity, and 45% lower power and energy per bit compared to the baseline design, each on an iso-bandwidth, iso-capacity, and iso-power basis."}

SliceMoE introduces Dynamic Bit-Sliced Caching (DBSC), which caches experts at slice-level granularity and assigns precision on demand to expand effective expert capacity.

We improve gem5, an open-source simulator with over 1600 forks, and gem5 Resources, a centralized repository of over 2000 pre-packaged artifacts, to address these issues. While gem5 Resources enables artifact sharing, researchers still face challenges. Creating custom disk images is complex and time-consuming, with no standardized process across ISAs, making it difficult to extend and share images. gem5 provides limited guest-host communication features through a set of predefined exit events that restrict researchers' ability to dynamically control and monitor simulations. Lastly, running simulations with multiple workloads requires researchers to write custom external scripts to coordinate multiple gem5 simulations which creates error-prone and hard-to-reproduce workflows. To overcome this, we introduce several features in gem5 and gem5 Resources. We standardize disk-image creation across x86, ARM, and RISC-V using Packer, and provide validated base images with pre-annotated benchmark suites (NPB, GAPBS). We provide 12 new disk images, 6 new kernels, and over 200 workloads across three ISAs. We refactor the exit event system to a class-based model and introduce hypercalls for enhanced guest-host communication that allows researchers to define custom behavior for their exit events. We also provide a utility to remotely monitor simulations and the gem5-bridge driver for user-space m5 operations. Additionally, we implemented Suites and MultiSim to enable parallel full-system simulations from gem5 configuration scripts, eliminating the need for external scripting.

In this work, we remedy this gap and introduce PIE-P, a fine-grained energy prediction framework for multi-GPU inference, including tensor, pipeline, and data parallelism. Predicting the energy under parallelized inference is complicated by the non-determinism in inter-GPU communication, additional communication overheads, and difficulties in isolating energy during the communication/synchronization phase.

Second, we introduce a dataflow analyzer that generalizes loop scheduling, resource mapping, and tile selection to the distributed memory hierarchy; it determines the optimal execution order and tile sizes by quantifying data movement across memory levels. Finally, FlashFuser integrates these components into a unified search engine that employs analytical cost modeling and DSM-aware pruning strategies to efficiently discover the optimal execution plan. Our evaluation on an NVIDIA H100 GPU shows that FlashFuser reduces memory access by 58% and delivers kernel speedups of 3.3x against highly-tuned libraries and 4.1x against state-of-the-art compilers, resulting in a 1.24x end-to-end speedup."}

Powering down unused nodes can mitigate this problem, but poorly timed transitions introduce long delays and reduce overall performance. To address this trade-off, we present SPARS, a reinforcement learning-enabled simulator for power management in HPC job scheduling. SPARS integrates job scheduling and node power state management within a discrete-event simulation framework. It supports traditional scheduling policies such as First Come First Served and EASY Backfilling, along with enhanced variants that employ reinforcement learning agents to dynamically decide when nodes should be powered on or off. Users can configure workloads and platforms in JSON format, specifying job arrivals, execution times, node power models, and transition delays. The simulator records comprehensive metrics-including energy usage, wasted power, job waiting times, and node utilization-and provides Gantt chart visualizations to analyze scheduling dynamics and power transitions. Unlike widely used Batsim-based frameworks that rely on heavy inter-process communication, SPARS provides lightweight event handling and consistent simulation results, making experiments easier to reproduce and extend. Its modular design allows new scheduling heuristics or learning algorithms to be integrated with minimal effort. By providing a flexible, reproducible, and extensible platform, SPARS enables researchers and practitioners to systematically evaluate power-aware scheduling strategies, explore the trade-offs between energy efficiency and performance, and accelerate the development of sustainable HPC operations."}

García-Fernández", "Simo Särkkä"], "title": "Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms."}

However, enabling large-scale training on early-life AI accelerators faces three core challenges: frequent system disruptions and undefined failure modes that undermine reliability; numerical errors and training instabilities that threaten correctness and convergence; and the complexity of parallelism optimization combined with unpredictable local noise that degrades efficiency. To address these challenges, SIGMA is an open-source training stack designed to improve the reliability, stability, and efficiency of large-scale distributed training on early-life AI hardware. The core of this initiative is the LUCIA TRAINING PLATFORM (LTP), the system optimized for clusters with early-life AI accelerators. Since its launch in March 2025, LTP has significantly enhanced training reliability and operational productivity. Over the past five months, it has achieved an impressive 94.45% effective cluster accelerator utilization, while also substantially reducing node recycling and job-recovery times. Building on the foundation of LTP, the LUCIA TRAINING FRAMEWORK (LTF) successfully trained SIGMA-MOE, a 200B MoE model, using 2,048 AI accelerators. This effort delivered remarkable stability and efficiency outcomes, achieving 21.08% MFU, state-of-the-art downstream accuracy, and encountering only one stability incident over a 75-day period. Together, these advances establish SIGMA, which not only tackles the critical challenges of large-scale training but also establishes a new benchmark for AI infrastructure and platform innovation, offering a robust, cost-effective alternative to prevailing established accelerator stacks and significantly advancing AI capabilities and scalability. The source code of SIGMA is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LuciaTrainingPlatform."}

Existing solutions often deploy the entire model as a single monolithic unit, which applies a unified resource configuration to both attention and expert modules despite their different requirements, leading to limited scalability and resource inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Janus, a scalable MoE inference system that disaggregates attention and experts on separate GPU sub-clusters, enabling each module to be managed and scaled independently. Janus incorporates three key designs for efficient, disaggregated MoE inference. First, it proposes an adaptive two-phase communication scheme that exploits intra- and inter-node bandwidth hierarchies for low-latency data exchange. Second, motivated by the memory-bound nature of MoE modules, Janus introduces a lightweight scheduler and implements it as a GPU kernel to balance the number of activated experts across GPUs at minimal overhead, thereby reducing inference latency. Third, Janus performs fine-grained resource management to dynamically adjust expert placement and independently scale attention and MoE resources to improve overall efficiency. Evaluation shows Janus achieves up to 3.9 higher perGPU throughput than state-of-the-art systems while meeting per-token latency requirements."}

Yet, current radio-interferometric pipelines utilize only a small fraction of hardware peak performance, typically 4-14%, due to memory and I/O bottlenecks, resulting in poor energy efficiency and high operational and carbon costs. Progress is further limited by the absence of standardised metrics and fidelity tolerances, preventing principled hardware-software co-design and rigorous exploration of quality-efficiency trade-offs. We introduce astroCAMP, a framework for guiding the co-design of next-generation imaging pipelines and sustainable HPC architectures that maximise scientific return within SKA's operational and environmental limits. astroCAMP provides: (1) a unified, extensible metric suite covering scientific fidelity, computational performance, sustainability, and lifecycle economics; (2) standardised SKA-representative datasets and reference outputs enabling reproducible benchmarking across CPUs, GPUs, and emerging accelerators; and (3) a multi-objective co-design formulation linking scientific-quality constraints to time-, energy-, carbon-to-solution, and total cost of ownership. We release datasets, benchmarking results, and a reproducibility kit, and evaluate co-design metrics for WSClean and IDG on an AMD EPYC 9334 processor and an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Further, we illustrate the use of astroCAMP for heterogeneous CPU-FPGA design-space exploration, and its potential to facilitate the identification of Pareto-optimal operating points for SKA-scale imaging deployments. Last, we make a call to the SKA community to define quantifiable fidelity metrics and thresholds to accelerate principled optimisation for SKA-scale imaging."}

For evaluation, we apply our framework to GEMM targeting a large acceleration configuration (e.g., 32x32 tiles, 1979 TFLOPS@FP8, 4 TB/s Bandwidth) comparable to an NVIDIA GH200. We achieve higher PE utilization than GH200 with its expert-tuned GEMM libraries, achieving 1.2-2.0x speedup across diverse matrix shapes."}

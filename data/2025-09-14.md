### [1] [Towards Verified Compilation of Floating-point Optimization in Scientific Computing Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09019)
*Mohit Tekriwal,John Sarracino*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 通过验证LLVM框架在Rocq定理证明器中证明浮点数FMA优化的正确性，并提出扩展更多程序特征和快速数学优化的方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学计算程序需要终极优化来获得高性能，但同时必须确保这些优化的正确性，特别是浮点数运算优化

Method: 利用Rocq定理证明器中的Verified LLVM框架，证明FMA优化在基本块a*b+c算术表达式中的正确性

Result: 完成了FMA优化正确性的初步证明工作

Conclusion: 该研究为验证浮点数优化正确性提供了基础，并提出了向更复杂程序特征和更多快速数学优化扩展的方向

Abstract: Scientific computing programs often undergo aggressive compiler optimization
to achieve high performance and efficient resource utilization. While
performance is critical, we also need to ensure that these optimizations are
correct. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of optimizations,
floating-point optimizations, notably due to fast math, at the LLVM IR level.
We present a preliminary work, which leverages the Verified LLVM framework in
the Rocq theorem prover, to prove the correctness of Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA)
optimization for a basic block implementing the arithmetic expression $a * b +
c$ . We then propose ways to extend this preliminary results by adding more
program features and fast math floating-point optimizations.

### [2] [Dependent-Type-Preserving Memory Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09059)
*Paulette Koronkevich,William J. Bowman*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 依赖类型语言在编译后类型规范会被擦除，导致外部链接程序可能违反原始程序规范。本文提出通过类型保持编译和依赖内存分配的中间语言来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 依赖类型语言如Coq、Agda等允许编写详细程序规范，但这些规范在编译后被擦除，外部链接程序可能违反原始程序的内存安全等规范，即使使用验证编译器也无法避免。

Method: 开发支持依赖内存分配的类型化中间语言，以及依赖类型保持的内存分配编译器传递，通过在链接时进行类型检查来防止与类型不正确的程序链接。

Result: 这是一项进行中的工作，提出了类型保持编译的方法论框架来解决依赖类型程序编译后的规范违反问题。

Conclusion: 通过类型保持编译和依赖内存分配的中间语言，可以在链接时保持类型信息，防止外部程序违反原始程序的依赖类型规范。

Abstract: Dependently typed programming languages such as Coq, Agda, Idris, and F*,
allow programmers to write detailed specifications of their programs and prove
their programs meet these specifications. However, these specifications can be
violated during compilation since they are erased after type checking. External
programs linked with the compiled program can violate the specifications of the
original program and change the behavior of the compiled program -- even when
compiled with a verified compiler. For example, since Coq does not allow
explicitly allocating memory, a programmer might link their Coq program with a
C program that can allocate memory. Even if the Coq program is compiled with a
verified compiler, the external C program can still violate the memory-safe
specification of the Coq program by providing an uninitialized pointer to
memory. This error could be ruled out by type checking in a language expressive
enough to indicate whether memory is initialized versus uninitialized. Linking
with a program with an uninitialized pointer could be considered ill-typed, and
our linking process could prevent linking with ill-typed programs. To
facilitate type checking during linking, we can use type-preserving
compilation, which preserves the types through the compilation process. In this
ongoing work, we develop a typed intermediate language that supports dependent
memory allocation, as well as a dependent-type-preserving compiler pass for
memory allocation.

### [3] [A Comparative Analysis of Identifier Schemes: UUIDv4, UUIDv7, and ULID for Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08969)
*Nima Karimian Kakolaki*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 该论文对分布式标识符方案进行了综合分析，通过理论计算和实验验证，证明ULIDs在网络开销、生成速度和冲突风险方面显著优于UUIDv4和UUIDv7，是高性能分布式系统的最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式系统需要突破性、可扩展的标识符方案来确保数据唯一性和在多节点上的高效索引。

Method: 结合冲突概率的数学计算与在模拟分布式环境中测量生成速度和网络传输开销的实验实验，对比传统自增键、UUIDv4、UUIDv7和ULIDs。

Result: ULIDs显著超过UUIDv4和UUIDv7，网络开销减少83.7%，生成速度提高97.32%，冲突风险比UUIDv7低98.42%，即使在高生成速率下也保持可忽略的冲突概率。

Conclusion: ULIDs是高性能分布式系统的最佳选择，提供了高效、时间排序和字典排序能力的标识符，适用于可扩展应用。

Abstract: Distributed systems require robust, scalable identifier schemes to ensure
data uniqueness and efficient indexing across multiple nodes. This paper
presents a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of distributed identifiers,
comparing traditional auto-increment keys with UUIDv4, UUIDv7, and ULIDs. We
combine mathematical calculation of collision probabilities with empirical
experiments measuring generation speed and network transmission overhead in a
simulated distributed environment. Results demonstrate that ULIDs significantly
outperform UUIDv4 and UUIDv7, reducing network overhead by 83.7% and increasing
generation speed by 97.32%. statistical analysis further shows ULIDs offer a
98.42% lower collision risk compared to UUIDv7, while maintaining negligible
collision probabilities even at high generation rates. These findings highlight
ULIDs as an optimal choice for high-performance distributed systems, providing
efficient, time-ordered, and lexicographically sortable identifiers suitable
for scalable applications. All source code, datasets, and analysis scripts
utilized in this research are publicly available in our dedicated repository at
https://github.com/nimakarimiank/uids-comparison. This repository contains
comprehensive documentation of the experimental setup, including configuration
files for the distributed environment, producer and consumer implementations,
and message broker integration. Additionally, it provides the data scripts and
datasets. Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to explore the
repository for full reproducibility of the experiments and to facilitate
further investigation or extension of the presented work.

### [4] [Optimizing the Variant Calling Pipeline Execution on Human Genomes Using GPU-Enabled Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09058)
*Ajay Kumar,Praveen Rao,Peter Sanders*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法，通过预测变异检测流水线各阶段执行时间和优化调度，在GPU机器上实现了更高效的基因组变异检测工作负荷执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子计算密集型的变异检测在云环境中处理时，需要有效利用GPU资源并最小化总执行时间，以降低计算成本。

Method: 采用机器学习预测变异检测流水线各阶段执行时间，基于基因组序列特征（如序列大小、读质量等），然后使用灵活作业店调度问题的思想生成最优执行计划，通过精心同步执行。

Result: 在公开基因组序列工作负荷上，方法能够准确预测执行时间，相比贪心方法获得2倍加速，相比动态调度方法获得1.6倍加速。

Conclusion: 机器学习结合优化调度策略可以显著提高基因组变异检测在GPU环境下的执行效率，为大规模基因组数据处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Variant calling is the first step in analyzing a human genome and aims to
detect variants in an individual's genome compared to a reference genome. Due
to the computationally-intensive nature of variant calling, genomic data are
increasingly processed in cloud environments as large amounts of compute and
storage resources can be acquired with the pay-as-you-go pricing model. In this
paper, we address the problem of efficiently executing a variant calling
pipeline for a workload of human genomes on graphics processing unit
(GPU)-enabled machines. We propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach
for optimizing the workload execution to minimize the total execution time. Our
approach encompasses two key techniques: The first technique employs ML to
predict the execution times of different stages in a variant calling pipeline
based on the characteristics of a genome sequence. Using the predicted times,
the second technique generates optimal execution plans for the machines by
drawing inspiration from the flexible job shop scheduling problem. The plans
are executed via careful synchronization across different machines. We
evaluated our approach on a workload of publicly available genome sequences
using a testbed with different types of GPU hardware. We observed that our
approach was effective in predicting the execution times of variant calling
pipeline stages using ML on features such as sequence size, read quality,
percentage of duplicate reads, and average read length. In addition, our
approach achieved 2X speedup (on an average) over a greedy approach that also
used ML for predicting the execution times on the tested workload of sequences.
Finally, our approach achieved 1.6X speedup (on an average) over a dynamic
approach that executed the workload based on availability of resources without
using any ML-based time predictions.

### [5] [Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling for Realistic Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09094)
*Guochu Xiong,Xiangzhong Luo,Weichen Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: CoTAM是一个缓存一致性感知的任务图建模框架，通过解耦一致性影响、量化其权重并推断任务间依赖关系，为真实工作负载构建统一的任务图，解决了传统静态方法无法处理动态数据依赖行为的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多核系统扩展，缓存一致性成为系统性能关键因素。传统任务图建模依赖预定义图，但现实应用缺乏显式图且具有动态数据依赖行为，现有方法要么使用隐式技术不生成显式图，要么生成针对固定调度模型的图，且往往忽略一致性交互，导致设计假设与实际运行时行为存在差距。

Method: CoTAM框架通过三个关键步骤：1) 解耦缓存一致性影响与整体执行；2) 通过学习权重方案量化一致性影响；3) 推断任务间依赖关系以生成一致性感知的任务图。

Result: 大量实验表明，CoTAM优于隐式方法，弥合了动态工作负载行为与现有设计之间的差距，证明了将缓存一致性纳入任务图建模对于准确和可泛化的系统级分析的重要性。

Conclusion: CoTAM成功解决了现有任务图建模方法的局限性，通过显式考虑缓存一致性交互，为真实工作负载提供了更准确和通用的系统级分析基础，显著提升了多核系统性能分析的准确性。

Abstract: As multicore systems continue to scale, cache coherence has emerged as a
critical determinant of system performance, with coherence behavior and task
execution closely intertwined, reshaping inter-task dependencies. Task graph
modeling provides a structured way to capture such dependencies and serves as
the foundation for many system-level design strategies. However, these
strategies typically rely on predefined task graphs, while many real-world
applications lack explicit graphs and exhibit dynamic, data-dependent behavior,
limiting the effectiveness of static approaches. To address this, several task
graph modeling methods for realistic workloads have been developed. Yet, they
either rely on implicit techniques that use application-specific features
without producing explicit graphs, or they generate graphs tailored to fixed
scheduling models, which limits generality. More importantly, they often
overlook coherence interactions, creating a gap between design assumptions and
actual runtime behavior. To overcome these limitations, we propose CoTAM, a
Coherence-Aware Task Graph Modeling framework for realistic workloads that
constructs a unified task graph reflecting runtime behavior. CoTAM analyzes the
impact of coherence by decoupling its effects from overall execution,
quantifies its influence through a learned weighting scheme, and infers
inter-task dependencies for coherence-aware graph generation. Extensive
experiments show that CoTAM outperforms implicit methods, bridging the gap
between dynamic workload behavior and existing designs while demonstrating the
importance of incorporating cache coherence into task graph modeling for
accurate and generalizable system-level analysis.

Conclusion: 两种技术各有优势：WebAssembly适用于轻量函数的快速启动，而Firecracker更适合复杂咈I/O密集型的服务器无计算工作负载。

Abstract: Serverless computing at the edge requires lightweight execution environments
to minimize cold start latency, especially in Urgent Edge Computing (UEC). This
paper compares WebAssembly and unikernel-based MicroVMs for serverless
workloads. We present Limes, a WebAssembly runtime built on Wasmtime, and
evaluate it against the Firecracker-based environment used in SPARE. Results
show that WebAssembly offers lower cold start times for lightweight functions
but suffers with complex workloads, while Firecracker provides higher, but
stable, cold starts and better execution performance, particularly for
I/O-heavy tasks.

### [7] [Barycentric Coded Distributed Computing with Flexible Recovery Threshold for Collaborative Mobile Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09435)
*Houming Qiu,Kun Zhu,Dusit Niyato,Nguyen Cong Luong,Changyan Yi,Chen Dai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出基于重心有理插值的近似编码分布式计算方案，解决现有CDC方案恢复阈值固定和数值不稳定问题，支持任意结果解码并确保数值稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 基于重心有理插值(BRI)设计近似CDC方案，开发BRI-based梯度编码算法，支持有限域和实数域计算

Result: 实验结果表明该方案在等待时间和近似精度方面优于现有CDC方案，能够利用任意返回结果解码，实现灵活的精度调节

Conclusion: 所提出的BRI-based CDC方案有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了更高的灵活性、数值稳定性和计算精度，显著提升了移动边缘计算系统的性能

Abstract: Collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to enable low-capability edge nodes to cooperatively execute
computation-intensive tasks. However, straggling edge nodes (stragglers)
significantly degrade the performance of MEC systems by prolonging computation
latency. While coded distributed computing (CDC) as an effective technique is
widely adopted to mitigate straggler effects, existing CDC schemes exhibit two
critical limitations: (i) They cannot successfully decode the final result
unless the number of received results reaches a fixed recovery threshold, which
seriously restricts their flexibility; (ii) They suffer from inherent poles in
their encoding/decoding functions, leading to decoding inaccuracies and
numerical instability in the computational results. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes an approximated CDC scheme based on
barycentric rational interpolation. The proposed CDC scheme offers several
outstanding advantages. Firstly, it can decode the final result leveraging any
returned results from workers. Secondly, it supports computations over both
finite and real fields while ensuring numerical stability. Thirdly, its
encoding/decoding functions are free of poles, which not only enhances
approximation accuracy but also achieves flexible accuracy tuning. Fourthly, it
integrates a novel BRI-based gradient coding algorithm accelerating the
training process while providing robustness against stragglers. Finally,
experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is superior to existing
CDC schemes in both waiting time and approximate accuracy.

### [8] [Weaker Assumptions for Asymmetric Trust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09493)
*Ignacio Amores-Sesar,Christian Cachin,Juan Villacis*

Main category: cs.DC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不对称信任模型中的解决方案假设过于严格，影响了不对称信任的优势，需要更弱假设的算法。

Method: 提出了一种新的不对称问题特征化方法，并基于此设计了可靠广播和共识算法，这些算法的假设要比现有方案更弱。

Result: 新算法在更弱的假设下实现了可靠广播和共识，保持了不对称信任的优势，并可扩展到其他核心问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为不对称信任系统提供了更实用的解决方案，减少了假设要求，同时保持了系统的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In distributed systems with asymmetric trust, each participant is free to
make its own trust assumptions about others, captured by an asymmetric quorum
system. This contrasts with ordinary, symmetric quorum systems and threshold
models, where trust assumptions are uniformly shared among participants.
Fundamental problems like reliable broadcast and consensus are unsolvable in
the asymmetric model if quorum systems satisfy only the classical properties of
consistency and availability. Existing approaches overcome this by introducing
stronger assumptions. We show that some of these assumptions are overly
restrictive, so much so that they effectively eliminate the benefits of
asymmetric trust. To address this, we propose a new approach to characterize
asymmetric problems and, building upon it, present algorithms for reliable
broadcast and consensus that require weaker assumptions than previous
solutions. Our methods are general and can be extended to other core problems
in systems with asymmetric trust.

TL;DR: TrEnv是一个专为LLM代理优化的无服务器平台，通过可重用的沙箱和内存模板等技术，显著降低了启动延迟和内存使用，在容器和VM环境中都比现有系统表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无服务器计算基础设施对于LLM代理等新兴工作负载存在瓶颈，其开销可能达到LLM API调用成本的70%，需要更高效的高密度无服务器平台。

Method: TrEnv采用协同设计方法，支持容器和VM环境，通过可重用的沙箱、内存模板、浏览器共享和页面缓存绕过机制来优化执行环境。

Result: 评估显示TrEnv在容器环境中将P99延迟降低7倍，内存使用减少48%；在VM环境中P99延迟降低58%，内存节省61%。

Conclusion: TrEnv通过专门针对LLM代理需求的设计，有效解决了无服务器平台在支持新兴工作负载时的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Serverless computing provides dynamic scalability, but its infrastructure
overhead becomes a bottleneck for emerging workloads such as LLM agents, which
exhibit unpredictable invocation patterns and variable resource demands. Our
analysis shows that for these agents, the cost of running on serverless
platforms can reach up to 70% of the cost of LLM API calls. This finding
motivates the need for a more efficient, high-density serverless platform. We
present TrEnv, a co-designed serverless platform that supports both container-
and VM-based environments, optimized for the unique demands of LLM agents.
TrEnv reduces startup latency and memory usage through repurposable sandboxes
and memory templates, which enable fast reuse and restoration of execution
environments. To further reduce overhead in VM-based agent workloads, TrEnv
leverages browser sharing and a page cache bypassing mechanism. Evaluations
show that TrEnv reduces P99 latency by up to 7X and memory usage by 48% in
container-based settings, and achieves up to 58% lower P99 latency and 61%
memory savings for VM-based agents compared to state-of-the-art systems like
E2B.

Abstract: Wallace tree multipliers are a parallel digital multiplier architecture
designed to minimize the worst-case time complexity of the circuit depth
relative to the input size [1]. In particular, it seeks to perform long
multiplication in the binary sense, reducing as many partial products per stage
as possible through full and half adders circuits, achieving O(log(n)) where n
= bit length of input. This paper provides an overview of the design, progress
and methodology in the final project of ECE 55900, consisting of the schematic
and layout of a Wallace tree 8-bit input multiplier on the gpdk45 technology in
Cadence Virtuoso, as well as any design attempts prior to the final product.
This also includes our endeavors in designing the final MAC (Multiply
Accumulate) unit with undefined targets, which we chose to implement as a 16
bit combinational multiply-add.

TL;DR: PLENA是一个软硬件协同设计的系统，专门针对长上下文LLM推理中的内存带宽和容量瓶颈问题，通过非对称量化方案、扁平化脉动阵列架构和完整工具链，实现了比现有加速器最高8.5倍的利用率提升。


<details>

Conclusion: PLENA通过软硬件协同设计有效解决了长上下文LLM推理中的内存墙问题，显著提升了硬件利用率和推理吞吐量，该系统将开源发布。

Abstract: LLMs now form the backbone of AI agents for a diverse array of applications,
including tool use, command-line agents, and web or computer use agents. These
agentic LLM inference tasks are fundamentally different from chatbot-focused
inference -- they often have much larger context lengths to capture complex,
prolonged inputs, such as entire webpage DOMs or complicated tool call
trajectories. This, in turn, generates significant off-chip memory traffic for
the underlying hardware at the inference stage and causes the workload to be
constrained by two memory walls, namely the bandwidth and capacity memory
walls, preventing the on-chip compute units from achieving high utilization.
  In this paper, we introduce PLENA, a hardware-software co-designed system
that applies three core optimization pathways to tackle these challenges. PLENA
includes an efficient hardware implementation of compute and memory units
supporting an asymmetric quantization scheme. PLENA also features a novel
flattened systolic array architecture that has native support for
FlashAttention to tackle these memory walls in the scenario of inference
serving for long-context LLMs. Additionally, PLENA is developed with a complete
stack, including a custom ISA, a compiler, a cycle-emulated simulator, and an
automated design space exploration flow. The simulated results show that PLENA
achieves up to 8.5x higher utilization than existing accelerators, and delivers
2.24x higher throughput than the A100 GPU and 3.85x higher throughput than the
TPU v6e, under the same multiplier count and memory settings. The full PLENA
system will also be open-sourced.

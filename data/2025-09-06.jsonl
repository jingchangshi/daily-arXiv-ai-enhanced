The framework generates a unified stream of\ninstructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route\ninformation on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with\nminimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip\nmemory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a\nprogrammable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data\nmovement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques\nsuch as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.\nApplied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),\nwith over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of\ntime consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s\non larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation\nreach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness\nof streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution\nstyle by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware."}

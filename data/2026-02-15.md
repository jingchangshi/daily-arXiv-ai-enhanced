### [1] [Compiler-Guided Inference-Time Adaptation: Improving GPT-5 Programming Performance in Idris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11481)
*Minda Li,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: GPT-5在低资源函数式编程语言Idris中表现不佳，但通过基于编译器错误的迭代提示策略，性能从22/56提升到54/56


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GPT-5在低资源或不常用编程语言中的能力，特别是函数式编程语言Idris，因为现有研究主要关注主流语言如Python、C++、Java

Method: 使用Exercism平台的Idris练习，首先建立零提示基线，然后评估多种改进策略：基于平台反馈的迭代提示、增强文档和错误分类指南、以及基于本地编译错误和失败测试用例的迭代提示

Result: 零提示下GPT-5仅解决22/56个Idris问题（Python为45/50，Erlang为35/47）。使用本地编译错误引导的迭代提示策略效果最好，将性能提升到54/56个问题

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在低资源环境中可能初始表现不佳，但结构化编译器级别的反馈对于释放其能力至关重要

Abstract: GPT-5, a state of the art large language model from OpenAI, demonstrates strong performance in widely used programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java; however, its ability to operate in low resource or less commonly used languages remains underexplored. This work investigates whether GPT-5 can effectively acquire proficiency in an unfamiliar functional programming language, Idris, through iterative, feedback driven prompting. We first establish a baseline showing that with zero shot prompting the model solves only 22 out of 56 Idris exercises using the platform Exercism, substantially underperforming relative to higher resource languages (45 out of 50 in Python and 35 out of 47 in Erlang). We then evaluate several refinement strategies, including iterative prompting based on platform feedback, augmenting prompts with documentation and error classification guides, and iterative prompting using local compilation errors and failed test cases. Among these approaches, incorporating local compilation errors yields the most substantial improvements. Using this structured, error guided refinement loop, GPT-5 performance increased to an impressive 54 solved problems out of 56. These results suggest that while large language models may initially struggle in low resource settings, structured compiler level feedback can play a critical role in unlocking their capabilities.

### [2] [Real Life Is Uncertain. Consensus Should Be Too!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11362)
*Reginald Frank,Soujanya Ponnapalli,Octavio Lomeli,Neil Giridharan,Marcos K Aguilera,Natacha Crooks*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文主张用概率性故障模型替代传统的f阈值故障模型，以更好地反映实际故障复杂性，并优化共识协议的成本和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共识协议基于f阈值故障模型（最多f台机器故障），这过度简化了现实世界，限制了在成本和性能方面的优化机会。实际故障具有复杂性和细微差别，需要更精确的模型来捕捉。

Method: 提出概率性故障模型，利用单个机器的故障曲线，并探索绕过传统瓶颈（如多数仲裁交集）的方法，使系统能够更精确地处理实际故障模式。

Result: 概率性共识协议能够更准确地反映实际故障复杂性，通过利用个体故障曲线和避免传统瓶颈，可以实现更可靠、高效、经济且可持续的系统。

Conclusion: 概率性故障模型比传统的f阈值模型更能反映现实世界故障的复杂性，为构建更可靠、高效、经济且可持续的分布式系统提供了新的优化机会。

Abstract: Modern distributed systems rely on consensus protocols to build a fault-tolerant-core upon which they can build applications. Consensus protocols are correct under a specific failure model, where up to $f$ machines can fail. We argue that this $f$-threshold failure model oversimplifies the real world and limits potential opportunities to optimize for cost or performance. We argue instead for a probabilistic failure model that captures the complex and nuanced nature of faults observed in practice. Probabilistic consensus protocols can explicitly leverage individual machine \textit{failure curves} and explore side-stepping traditional bottlenecks such as majority quorum intersection, enabling systems that are more reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.

TL;DR: SparrowRL：针对松散耦合GPU集群的稀疏增量传输RL训练系统，大幅减少网络负载，提升吞吐量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL后训练需要频繁同步大模型参数，依赖昂贵的RDMA HPC集群。在标准以太网/WAN链路上，全权重广播同步8B模型需要100+秒，而生成rollout仅需数十秒，形成瓶颈。需要为资源受限环境设计实用RL方案。

Method: 基于RL微调产生稀疏更新的观察（约1%参数变化），提出SparrowRL系统：1）将每步更新表示为稀疏增量检查点；2）流水线化增量提取与多流传输；3）传输与rollout生成重叠；4）吞吐量和带宽感知调度加租约容错机制。

Result: 在Qwen3模型（4B-14B）跨最多4个地理区域部署中：1）Qwen3-8B每步传输负载减少79倍；2）WAN上吞吐量比全权重广播提升2.4-9.5倍；3）与理想RDMA单数据中心基线的吞吐差距缩小至8.91%内；4）按需跨云GPU比预留RDMA集群每美元token数高1.21-1.59倍。

Conclusion: SparrowRL通过稀疏增量传输机制，使RL训练在标准网络连接的松散耦合GPU集群上变得实用，显著降低基础设施成本，为资源受限组织提供可行的RL后训练方案。

Abstract: LLM post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) requires frequent synchronization of large model parameters between the trainer and distributed rollout actors. High-throughput RL post-training therefore relies on dedicated RDMA HPC clusters, an infrastructure cost most organizations cannot absorb. A natural alternative is to aggregate loosely-coupled GPUs over standard Ethernet and WAN links, but this commodity connectivity cannot sustain full-weight broadcasts: synchronizing an 8B model can take over 100~seconds on bandwidth-limited links, while rollout generation typically takes tens of seconds.
  Toward making RL practical in this regime, we observe that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse per-step updates, with only around 1\% of parameter elements changing. Atop this insight, we present SparrowRL, a novel high-performance RL training system that preserves bit-exact updates without dropping or quantizing information, designed for commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources. SparrowRL represents each step as a sparse delta checkpoint, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and coordinates heterogeneous workers with throughput- and bandwidth-aware scheduling plus lease-based fault tolerance. On Qwen3 models from 4B to 14B deployed across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79$\times$ for Qwen3-8B and improves throughput by 2.4--9.5$\times$ over full-weight broadcast across WAN, narrowing the throughput gap relative to an ideal RDMA single-datacenter baseline to within 8.91\%. By leveraging on-demand, cross-cloud GPUs over commodity links, SparrowRL delivers 1.21--1.59$\times$ higher tokens per dollar than reserved RDMA clusters at comparable throughput.

### [4] [Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum Protocol and Its Application in Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11544)
*Yiming Zhou,Kaiping Xue,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出DPPS协议为去中心化通信提供轻量级差分隐私保护，并设计PartPSP算法在非凸优化中平衡隐私-效用权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化网络中节点无法确保邻居安全保存共享信息，现有差分隐私方法多针对特定下游任务，缺乏通用的协议级隐私保护方案

Method: 提出DPPS协议，包含新颖的敏感度估计机制，每个节点每轮只需计算广播一个标量；设计PartPSP算法，将模型参数分为本地和共享部分，仅对共享参数应用DPPS

Result: 理论证明PartPSP在非凸目标下收敛，在相同隐私预算下通过部分通信获得更好优化性能；实验验证DPPS的隐私保护有效性，PartPSP优于现有隐私保护去中心化优化算法

Conclusion: DPPS为去中心化通信提供通用、低成本的差分隐私协议，PartPSP通过部分通信机制在非凸优化中实现更好的隐私-效用平衡

Abstract: In decentralized networks, nodes cannot ensure that their shared information will be securely preserved by their neighbors, making privacy vulnerable to inference by curious nodes. Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms.

### [5] [LAER-MoE: Load-Adaptive Expert Re-layout for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11686)
*Xinyi Liu,Yujie Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Xuefeng Xiao,Huixia Li,Jiashi Li,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LAER-MoE是一个高效的MoE训练框架，通过全分片专家并行（FSEP）和负载均衡规划器解决专家并行训练中的负载不平衡问题，相比现有最优系统实现1.69倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专家并行训练中，动态路由导致专家间负载严重不平衡，少数过载专家成为训练瓶颈，需要解决这一问题以提升训练效率。

Method: 提出全分片专家并行（FSEP）范式，将每个专家参数完全分片到所有设备，通过All-to-All通信在训练期间按专家粒度恢复部分专家；采用细粒度通信调度减少开销；开发负载均衡规划器制定专家重布局策略和令牌路由方案。

Result: 在A100集群上的实验表明，相比当前最优训练系统，LAER-MoE实现了最高1.69倍的加速。

Conclusion: LAER-MoE通过创新的并行范式和负载均衡机制，有效解决了MoE训练中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Expert parallelism is vital for effectively training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, enabling different devices to host distinct experts, with each device processing different input data. However, during expert parallel training, dynamic routing results in significant load imbalance among experts: a handful of overloaded experts hinder overall iteration, emerging as a training bottleneck.
  In this paper, we introduce LAER-MoE, an efficient MoE training framework. The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing. In particular, we perform fine-grained scheduling of communication operations to minimize communication overhead. Additionally, we develop a load balancing planner to formulate re-layout strategies of experts and routing schemes for tokens during training. We perform experiments on an A100 cluster, and the results indicate that our system achieves up to 1.69x acceleration compared to the current state-of-the-art training systems.

### [6] [Designing Scalable Rate Limiting Systems: Algorithms, Architecture, and Distributed Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11741)
*Bo Guan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Redis Sorted Set的分布式限流系统架构，采用滚动窗口算法，通过Lua脚本实现原子操作，并在Redis集群上部署，在CAP定理中选择了AP权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计同时具备准确性、可用性和可扩展性的分布式限流系统面临根本性挑战，主要源于算法精度、可用性、一致性和分区容忍性之间的权衡。

Method: 采用Redis内存缓存数据库及其Sorted Set数据结构，实现O(log(N))时间复杂度的操作；使用滚动窗口算法；通过服务器端Lua脚本将清理、计数和插入捆绑为原子操作；提出三层架构管理限流规则；在Redis集群上部署实现数据分片和复制。

Result: 量化了滚动窗口算法与令牌桶、固定窗口算法在精度和内存成本之间的权衡；通过Lua脚本消除了并发环境中的竞态条件；通过规则参数哈希实现规则变更无需修改缓存脚本；Redis集群部署提供了可用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该架构为生产级环境提供了实用的分布式限流解决方案，在CAP定理中选择了可用性和分区容忍性（AP）作为工程权衡，平衡了精度、性能和可扩展性需求。

Abstract: Designing a rate limiter that is simultaneously accurate, available, and scalable presents a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, primarily due to the trade-offs between algorithmic precision, availability, consistency, and partition tolerance. This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case.

### [7] [An Auction-Based Mechanism for Optimal Task Allocation and Resource Aware Containerization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11998)
*Ramakant kumar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 提出AUC-RAC拍卖机制，基于Docker Swarm实现IoT环境中多本地服务器间的计算任务卸载优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IoT环境中，分布式计算虽然能协调多个设备并行执行资源密集型任务，但在基于云的容器化环境中，资源管理和成本优化仍是挑战，需要更高效的任务卸载机制

Method: 提出AUC-RAC拍卖机制，利用Docker Swarm连接多个本地服务器（管理节点和工作者节点），通过拍卖竞价过程优化计算任务分配，考虑各系统的资源充足性

Result: 实验分析表明，该方法通过促进本地服务器间的协作，为IoT设备提供了改进的任务卸载和计算密集型服务

Conclusion: AUC-RAC拍卖机制能有效优化IoT环境中多本地服务器间的计算任务分配，提高任务卸载效率和计算服务性能

Abstract: Distributed computing has enabled cooperation between multiple computing devices for the simultaneous execution of resource-hungry tasks. Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers.

TL;DR: 该论文研究具有全局时钟的竞争解决协议，设计了新的协议获得更优延迟，证明了随机协议在全局时钟和本地时钟之间的复杂度差距，并发现期望延迟和高概率延迟之间存在权衡，无法同时优化两者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争解决问题是分布式计算中的经典问题，传统研究假设参与者只能访问本地时钟。本文研究具有全局时钟的竞争解决协议，这一假设既技术现实又算法有趣，能够丰富问题并引入新技术。

Method: 设计了新的竞争解决协议，分析随机协议在全局时钟和本地时钟模型下的性能差异，研究期望延迟和高概率延迟两种度量标准下的复杂度关系，证明不同目标之间的权衡。

Result: 1) 新协议在期望和高概率下达到O(n(log log n)^{1+o(1)})延迟；2) 发现期望延迟和高概率延迟之间存在log n因子差距；3) 证明无法同时优化两种延迟度量。

Conclusion: 全局时钟假设显著改变了竞争解决问题的复杂度格局，在全局时钟模型下可以获得更好的延迟性能，但期望延迟和高概率延迟之间存在根本性权衡，无法同时达到最优。

Abstract: In the Contention Resolution problem $n$ parties each wish to have exclusive use of a shared resource for one unit of time. The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\left(\left(n\log\log n\log^{(3)} n\log^{(4)} n\cdots \log^{(\log^* n)} n\right)\cdot 2^{\log^* n}\right) \le n(\log\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \log n/\log\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: OServe：针对大语言模型服务中空间和时间异质性的异构灵活部署系统，通过工作负载感知调度和自适应切换，性能提升最高2倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统通常假设工作负载在空间上均匀、时间上稳定，采用同质静态模型部署。但实际工作负载存在空间异质性（请求的计算和内存需求各异）和时间异质性（工作负载组成随时间变化），这种假设与现实的时空异质性不匹配导致性能次优。

Method: 1. 引入新颖的工作负载感知调度算法，根据实时工作负载特征优化异构模型部署；2. 提出高效的工作负载自适应切换方法，根据预测的工作负载变化迁移模型部署。

Result: 在真实世界跟踪数据上的实验表明，OServe相比最先进的服务系统，性能提升最高达2倍（平均1.5倍）。

Conclusion: OServe通过异构灵活的模型部署有效解决了LLM服务中的空间和时间异质性问题，显著提升了服务性能。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit immensely from parallelizing both the model and input requests across multiple devices, but incoming workloads exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Spatially, workloads comprise heterogeneous requests with varying compute and memory demands. Temporally, workload composition varies over time. Nevertheless, existing systems typically assume spatially uniform and temporally stable workloads, employing a homogeneous, static model deployment. This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. First, OServe introduces a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments according to real-time workload characteristics. Second, OServe proposes an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes. Experiments on real-world traces show that OServe improves performance by up to 2$\times$ (average: 1.5$\times$) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents an ML-driven framework for automated RF physical synthesis that transforms circuit netlists into manufacturable GDSII layouts. While recent ML approaches demonstrate success in topology selection and parameter optimization, they fail to produce manufacturable layouts due to oversimplified component models and lack of routing capabilities. Our framework addresses these limitations through three key innovations: (1) a neural network framework trained on 18,210 inductor geometries with frequency sweeps from 1-100 GHz, generating 7.5 million training samples, that predicts inductor Q-factor with less than 2% error and enables fast gradient-based layout optimization with a 93.77% success rate in producing high-Q layouts; (2) an intelligent P-Cell optimizer that reduces layout area while maintaining design-rule-check (DRC) compliance; and (3) a complete placement and routing engine with frequency-dependent EM spacing rules and DRC-aware synthesis. The neural inductor model demonstrates superior accuracy across 1-100 GHz, enabling EM-accurate component synthesis with real-time inference. The framework successfully generates DRC-aware GDSII layouts for RF circuits, representing a significant step toward automated RF physical design.

TL;DR: PAM是一个KV中心的大型语言模型服务系统，通过协调异构内存设备解决KV操作的内存带宽和容量瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM请求量和上下文长度增长，KV相关操作（注意力计算和KV缓存存储）成为关键瓶颈，需要大量内存带宽和容量。现有LLM服务系统针对计算密集型工作负载优化，无法有效处理这些内存密集型操作，即使使用PIM技术，当前单级内存设计也无法同时满足带宽和容量需求。

Method: 1. 利用KV访问模式中的上下文局部性，智能地在内存层次结构中分布KV令牌；2. 引入PAMattention算法，支持跨异构PIM设备的细粒度并行注意力计算；3. 包含设备内KV映射、设备间KV迁移接口和设备间在线KV调度算法，动态平衡计算工作负载。

Result: PAM通过同时解决带宽和容量需求，显著提高了LLM服务系统的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: PAM为大规AI时代提供了成本效益高、高性能的解决方案，通过协调异构PIM内存设备的层次架构，平衡高内存带宽与可扩展容量。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exponentially increased the demand for efficient serving systems. With growing requests and context lengths, key-value (KV)-related operations, including attention computation and KV cache storage, have emerged as critical bottlenecks. They require massive memory bandwidth and capacity. Unfortunately, existing LLM serving systems, optimized for compute-bound workloads, fail to handle these memory-intensive operations effectively. Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.
  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture. PAM introduces a novel computing paradigm to balance high memory bandwidth with scalable capacity. First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads. By addressing both bandwidth and capacity demands simultaneously, PAM significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems, paving the way for cost-effective, high-performance solutions in the era of large-scale AI.

Motivation: 架构模拟器在早期微架构探索中至关重要，但其有效性受限于保真度问题：模拟器行为可能与最终RTL存在偏差，导致性能估计不可靠。因此需要模型校准来对齐模拟器与RTL的行为，以获得准确的性能建模。

Method: 提出Microarchitecture Cliffs基准生成方法：1）识别需要校准的关键架构组件；2）通过一组基准测试将微架构差异精确归因于单个微架构特性；3）开发自动化工具提高Cliff工作流程效率。应用该方法校准XiangShan版gem5（XS-GEM5）与开源CPU（XS-RTL）。

Result: 1）在Cliff基准测试上将XS-GEM5的性能误差从59.2%降低到1.4%；2）代表性紧密耦合微架构特性的相对误差降低48.03%；3）SPECint2017和SPECfp2017的绝对性能误差分别降低15.1%和21.0%。

Conclusion: Microarchitecture Cliffs方法能有效暴露模拟器与RTL之间的微架构行为差异，通过针对性校准显著提高模拟器的准确性，为架构探索提供更可靠的性能建模工具。

Abstract: Architectural simulators play a critical role in early microarchitectural exploration due to their flexibility and high productivity. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by fidelity: simulators may deviate from the behavior of the final RTL, leading to unreliable performance estimates. Consequently, model calibration, which aligns simulator behavior with the RTL as the ground-truth microarchitecture, becomes essential for achieving accurate performance modeling.
  To facilitate model calibration accuracy, we propose Microarchitecture Cliffs, a benchmark generation methodology designed to expose mismatches in microarchitectural behavior between the simulator and RTL. After identifying the key architectural components that require calibration, the Cliff methodology enables precise attribution of microarchitectural differences to a single microarchitectural feature through a set of benchmarks. In addition, we develop a set of automated tools to improve the efficiency of the Cliff workflow.
  We apply the Cliff methodology to calibrate the XiangShan version of gem5 (XS-GEM5) against the XiangShan open-source CPU (XS-RTL). We reduce the performance error of XS-GEM5 from 59.2% to just 1.4% on the Cliff benchmarks. Meanwhile, the calibration guided by Cliffs effectively reduces the relative error of a representative tightly coupled microarchitectural feature by 48.03%. It also substantially lowers the absolute performance error, with reductions of 15.1% and 21.0% on SPECint2017 and SPECfp2017, respectively.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions (AFMTJs) offer picosecond switching and high integration density for in-memory computing, but their ultrafast dynamics and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) make state-of-the-art MRAM interfaces unreliable. This work develops a device-circuit co-designed read/write interface optimized for AFMTJ behavior. Using a calibrated SPICE AFMTJ model as a baseline, we identify the limitations of conventional drivers and propose an asymmetric pulse driver (PD) for deterministic picosecond switching and a self-timed sense amplifier (STSA) with dynamic trip-point tuning for low-TMR sensing. Our experiments using SPICE and Monte Carlo evaluations demonstrate that the proposed circuits preserve AFMTJ latency and energy benefits while achieving robust read/write yield under realistic PVT and 3D integration parasitics, outperforming standard MRAM front-ends under the same conditions.

Conclusion: MING框架成功解决了边缘设备资源约束下的FPGA HLS设计问题，通过流式架构和缓冲管理实现了显著的性能提升，特别适合资源受限的边缘计算环境。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for low-latency and real-time processing, machine learning applications are steadily migrating toward edge computing platforms, where Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely adopted for their energy efficiency compared to CPUs and GPUs. To generate high-performance and low-power FPGA designs, several frameworks built upon High Level Synthesis (HLS) vendor tools have been proposed, among which MLIR-based frameworks are gaining significant traction due to their extensibility and ease of use. However, existing state-of-the-art frameworks often overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices. To address this limitation, we propose MING, an Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based framework that abstracts and automates the HLS design process. Within this framework, we adopt a streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers, specifically designed to handle resource constraints while ensuring low-latency. In comparison with recent frameworks, our approach achieves on average 15x speedup for standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernels with up to four layers, and up to 200x for single-layer kernels. For kernels with larger input sizes, MING is capable of generating efficient designs that respect hardware resource constraints, whereas state-of-the-art frameworks struggle to meet.

Recent work, TroVE, argues that code-generating Large Language\nModels (LLMs) can benefit similarly on the MATH benchmark by inducing and\nreusing higher-level toolboxes. By allocating computational budget across an\nensemble of three modes -- directly generating code, creating tools, and\nreusing tools -- TroVE claims to outperform a PRIMITIVE baseline that only\nperforms direct generation. However, recent analysis (Berlot-Attwell et al.,\n2024) casts doubt on these gains, noting that the tools created are often\ntrivial or rarely reused, suggesting that improvements may stem from\nself-consistency or self-correction. In this work, we re-evaluate TroVE on\nMATH, analyze the impact of each of its modes, and show that its benefit does\nnot come from these mechanisms, but simply from a higher computational budget\nspent for TroVE compared to PRIMITIVE. To this end, we also perform a small\ncorrection in the original implementation of TroVE's selection mechanism,\nboosting TroVE's performance on MATH by 3\\% in accuracy.

However, the limited storage capacity of edge servers poses\nsignificant challenges in handling high volume and latency sensitive data\naccess requests, particularly under dynamic workloads. In this work, we propose\na profit driven framework that integrates three key mechanisms which are\ncollaborative caching, erasure coding, and elastic storage partitioning. Unlike\ntraditional replication, erasure coding enables space efficient redundancy,\nallowing data to be reconstructed from any subset of K out of K plus M coded\nblocks. We dynamically partition each edge server s storage into private and\npublic regions. The private region is further subdivided among access points\nbased on their incoming request rates, enabling adaptive control over data\nlocality and ownership. We design a data placement and replacement policy that\ndetermines how and where to store or evict coded data blocks to maximize data\naccess within deadlines. While the private region serves requests from local\nAPs, the public region handles cooperative storage requests from neighboring\nservers. Our proposed Dynamic Space Partitioning and Elastic caching strategy\nis evaluated on both synthetic and real world traces from Netflix and Spotify.\nExperimental results show that our method improves overall system profitability\nby approximately 5 to 8% compared to state of the art approaches under varied\nworkload conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5229\u6da6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u534f\u4f5c\u7f13\u5b58\u3001\u7ea0\u5220\u7801\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u5b58\u50a8\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u533a\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5b58\u50a8\u4e3a\u79c1\u6709\u548c\u516c\u5171\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u79c1\u6709\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ec6\u5206\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u6240\u6709\u6743\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u66ff\u6362\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728Netflix\u548cSpotify\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u6da6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865%\u81f38%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u533a\u548c\u5f39\u6027\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u6da6\u3002"}}

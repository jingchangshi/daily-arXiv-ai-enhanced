While lightweight architectures like MobileNetV2 employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSC) to reduce computational complexity, their multi-stage design introduces a critical performance bottleneck inherent to layer-by-layer execution: the high energy and latency cost of transferring intermediate feature maps to either large on-chip buffers or off-chip DRAM. To address this memory wall, this paper introduces a novel hardware accelerator architecture that utilizes a fused pixel-wise dataflow. Implemented as a Custom Function Unit (CFU) for a RISC-V processor, our architecture eliminates the need for intermediate buffers entirely, reducing the data movement up to 87\\% compared to conventional layer-by-layer execution. It computes a single output pixel to completion across all DSC stages-expansion, depthwise convolution, and projection-by streaming data through a tightly-coupled pipeline without writing to memory. Evaluated on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA, our design achieves a speedup of up to 59.3x over the baseline software execution on the RISC-V core. Furthermore, ASIC synthesis projects a compact 0.284 mm$^2$ footprint with 910 mW power at 2 GHz in 28 nm, and a 1.20 mm$^2$ footprint with 233 mW power at 300 MHz in 40 nm. This work confirms the feasibility of a zero-buffer dataflow within a TinyML resource envelope, offering a novel and effective strategy for overcoming the memory wall in edge AI accelerators."}

Recent systems have explored architectural support for TLP on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), often leveraging high-level synthesis (HLS) to create processing elements (PEs). In this paper, we present Bombyx, a compiler toolchain that lowers OpenCilk programs into a Cilk-1-inspired intermediate representation, enabling efficient mapping of CPU-oriented TLP applications to spatial architectures on FPGAs. Unlike OpenCilk's implicit task model, which requires costly context switching in hardware, Cilk-1 adopts explicit continuation-passing - a model that better aligns with the streaming nature of FPGAs. Bombyx supports multiple compilation targets: one is an OpenCilk-compatible runtime for executing Cilk-1-style code using the OpenCilk backend, and another is a synthesizable PE generator designed for HLS tools like Vitis HLS. Additionally, we introduce a decoupled access-execute optimization that enables automatic generation of high-performance PEs, improving memory-compute overlap and overall throughput."}

The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime.

However, their unique architectural characteristics create performance dynamics that differ fundamentally from conventional accelerators. Existing workload optimization approaches for neuromorphic accelerators rely on aggregate network-wide sparsity and operation counting, but the extent to which these metrics actually improve deployed performance remains unknown. This paper presents the first comprehensive performance bound and bottleneck analysis of neuromorphic accelerators, revealing the shortcomings of the conventional metrics and offering an understanding of what facets matter for workload performance. We present both theoretical analytical modeling and extensive empirical characterization of three real neuromorphic accelerators: Brainchip AKD1000, Synsense Speck, and Intel Loihi 2. From these, we establish three distinct accelerator bottleneck states, memory-bound, compute-bound, and traffic-bound, and identify which workload configuration features are likely to exhibit these bottleneck states. We synthesize all of our insights into the floorline performance model, a visual model that identifies performance bounds and informs how to optimize a given workload, based on its position on the model. Finally, we present an optimization methodology that combines sparsity-aware training with floorline-informed partitioning. Our methodology achieves substantial performance improvements at iso-accuracy: up to 3.86x runtime improvement and 3.38x energy reduction compared to prior manually-tuned configurations."}

However, HoTT features an infinite hierarchy of equalities that may become unwieldy in formalisations. Fortunately, QITs and functional extensionality are both preserved even if the equality levels of Cubical Type Theory are truncated to only homotopical Sets (h-Sets). In other words, removing the univalence axiom from Cubical Type Theory and instead postulating a conflicting axiom: the Uniqueness of Identity Proofs (UIP) postulate. Since univalence is proved in Cubical Type Theory from the so-called Glue Types, therefore, it is known that one can first remove the Glue Types (thus removing univalence) and then set-truncate all equalities (essentially assuming UIP), à la XTT. The result is a \"h-Set Cubical Type Theory\" that retains features such as functional extensionality and QITs.\n  However, in Cubical Agda, there are currently only two unsatisfying ways to achieve h-Set Cubical Type Theory. The first is to give up on the canonicity of the theory and simply postulate the UIP axiom, while the second way is to use a standard result stating \"type formers preserve h-levels\" to manually prove UIP for every defined type. The latter is, however, laborious work best suited for an automatic implementation by the proof assistant. In this project, we analyse formulations of UIP and detail their computation rules for Cubical Agda, and evaluate their suitability for implementation. We also implement a variant of Cubical Agda without Glue, which is already compatible with postulated UIP, in anticipation of a future implementation of UIP in Cubical Agda."}

Many of the used verification approaches are in fact language-agnostic and it would be beneficial for the technology transfer to allow for using the implementations also for other programming and modeling languages. To address the problem, we propose SV-LIB, an exchange format and intermediate language for software-verification tasks, including programs, specifications, and verification witnesses. SV-LIBis based on well-known concepts from imperative programming languages and uses SMT-LIB to represent expressions and sorts used in the program. This makes it easy to parse and to build into existing infrastructure, since many verification tools are based on SMT solvers already. Furthermore, SV-LIBdefines a witness format for both correct and incorrect SV-LIB programs, together with means for specifying witness-validation tasks. This makes it possible both to implement independent witness validators and to reuse some verifiers also as validators for witnesses. This paper presents version 1.0 of the SV-LIBformat, including its design goals, the syntax, and informal semantics. Formal semantics and further extensions to concurrency are planned for future versions."}

Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations."}

This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes.

This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems."}

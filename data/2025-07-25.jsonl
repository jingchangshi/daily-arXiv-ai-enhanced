These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing\npolicies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput."}

In recent years, the rise of\nlanguages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions\nof coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most\nnotably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive\nreasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a\nprogram congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the\nlanguage. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as\n\\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific\nlanguage and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a\nuniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal\ndimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled\nby an \\emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very\ngeneral categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of\nbehavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via\nfibrations over the base category of an AHOS.

To address\nthese challenges, we present an optimized framework featuring four synergistic\nimprovements: (1) Asynchronous listener threads are introduced to address event\nmonitoring latency in large-scale scenarios, instead of synchronous polling\nmechanisms, (2) METIS-based load rebalancing strategy is incorporated to\naddress the issue of dynamic event allocation during real-world simulation, (3)\nEntity interaction solver with constraint satisfaction mechanisms is designed\nto mitigate state conflicts, and (4) Spatial hashing algorithm to overcome\nO(n^2) complexity bottlenecks in large-scale nearest-neighbor searches.\nExperimental validation through a GridWorld demo demonstrates significant\nenhancements in temporal fidelity and computational efficiency. Benchmark\nresults show our framework achieves 16x acceleration over baseline\nimplementations and maintains 8x speedup over 1-thread configuration across MPI\nand Pthreads implementations.The combined load balancing and LP migration\nstrategy reduces synchronization overhead by 58.18%, with load balancing\naccounting for 57% of the total improvement as the dominant optimization\nfactor. These improvements provide an enhanced solution for PDES implementation\nin large-scale simulation scenarios."}

Data\nreplication is a widely used technique that provides fault tolerance, improved\nperformance and higher availability. Traditional implementations often rely on\nthreshold-based activation mechanisms, which can vary depending on workload\nchanges and system architecture. System administrators typically bear the\nresponsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,\nreinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and\ndifferent architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication\nstrategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically\nlearn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim\nis to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off\nbetween provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture\nbehind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining\nthe states, actions and rewards."}

Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload\ndifferences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,\napplying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and\nutilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.\nWe propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses\ndifferent execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them\nseparately.\n  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU\nplatforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.\nSandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory\ntime-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up\nto 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant\nimprovement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels\ngenerated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other\ndynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers\nwith three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs."}

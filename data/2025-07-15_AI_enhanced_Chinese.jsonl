While successive generations of hardware platforms\nhave improved performance and energy efficiency, the question remains whether\nnew, more efficient platforms can realistically offset the rising emissions\nassociated with increasing demand. Prior studies often overlook the complex\ntrade-offs in such transitions by failing to account for both the economic\nincentives and the projected compute demand growth over the operational\nlifetime of the devices. In response, we present CEO-DC, an integrated model\nand decision-making methodology for Carbon and Economy Optimization in Data\nCenters. CEO-DC models the competing forces of cost, carbon, and compute demand\nto guide optimal platform procurement and replacement strategies. We propose\nmetrics to steer procurement, platform design, and policy decisions toward\nsustainable DC technologies. Given current platform trends, our AI case study\nusing CEO-DC shows that upgrading legacy devices on a 4-year cycle reduces\ntotal emissions. However, these upgrades fail to scale with DC demand growth\ntrends without increasing total emissions in over 44% of cases, and require\neconomic incentives for adoption in over 72%. Furthermore, current carbon\nprices are insufficient to motivate upgrades in 9 out of the 14 countries with\nthe highest number of DCs globally. We also find that optimizing platforms for\nenergy efficiency at the expense of latency can increase the carbon price\nrequired to justify their adoption.

Existing tools typically aim at managing control flow\ninternally, often at the expense of completeness, while offloading reasoning\nover data flow to SMT solvers. Moreover, reasoning typically happens on source\ncode or intermediate representation level to leverage structural information,\nmaking machine code generation part of the trust base. We are interested in\nchanging the equation in two non-trivial ways: pushing reasoning down to\nmachine code level, and then offloading reasoning entirely into SMT solvers and\nother, possibly more efficient solver technology. In more abstract terms, we\nare asking if bit-precise reasoning technology can be made scalable on\nsoftware, and not just hardware. For this purpose, we developed two tools\ncalled rotor and bitme for model generation and bounded model checking,\nrespectively. We chose RISC-V restricted to integer arithmetic as modeling\ntarget for rotor since RISC-V integer semantics is essentially equivalent to\nestablished SMT semantics over bitvectors and arrays of bitvectors. While\nstate-of-the-art SMT solvers struggle in our experiments, we have evidence that\nthere is potential for improvement. To show the potential, we have slightly\ngeneralized and then implemented in bitme two types of binary decision diagrams\n(BDDs): algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs) and context-free-language ordered\nbinary decision diagrams (CFLOBDDs). Bitme uses BDDs to propagate program input\nthrough models, essentially generalizing constant propagation to domain\npropagation. SMT solvers only get involved when model input cannot be\npropagated, significanly speeding up SMT solving.

Since the kernel governs critical system operations and\nenforces isolation boundaries between user space and privileged data, any\nmechanism that modifies its behavior must meet the highest standards of safety\nand correctness. To this end, the eBPF toolchain includes a verifier, which\nstatically checks safety properties such as memory access validity, bounded\nloops, and type correctness before loading the program into the kernel.\nHowever, the existing verifier is both overly conservative in some\ncases-rejecting valid programs-and unsound in others, permitting unsafe\nbehavior that violates the intended semantics of the kernel interface.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce BeePL, a domain-specific language\nfor eBPF with a formally verified type system.

First,\nconventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity\nof both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods\ndesigned to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of\nexploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the\nfluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC\noperations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for\ndual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant\nunderutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study\nproposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging\nparticlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of\npartial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more\narea- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less\nsignificant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware\nsimplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second\nchallenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level\nelasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC\nunit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the\nproposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency\ncompared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while\nmaintaining comparable energy efficiency. The approximate variant further\nimproves energy efficiency by 7.5%, compared to the exact version.

Furthermore, using a theoretical\nmachinery from complex systems, this paper also posits that inconsistency may\nbe an emergent feature of consensus over distributed systems by examining how a\nsystem transitions phases. Under the same complex systems framework, this paper\nexamines paraconsistent logics, arguing that while inconsistency is not an\nemergent feature for these logics, triviality may be.

The data distributed among the edge devices is highly heterogeneous.\nThus, FL faces the challenge of data distribution and heterogeneity, where\nnon-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across edge devices\nmay yield in significant accuracy drop. Furthermore, the limited computation\nand communication capabilities of edge devices increase the likelihood of\nstragglers, thus leading to slow model convergence. In this paper, we propose\nthe FedDHAD FL framework, which comes with two novel methods: Dynamic\nHeterogeneous model aggregation (FedDH) and Adaptive Dropout (FedAD). FedDH\ndynamically adjusts the weights of each local model within the model\naggregation process based on the non-IID degree of heterogeneous data to deal\nwith the statistical data heterogeneity. FedAD performs neuron-adaptive\noperations in response to heterogeneous devices to improve accuracy while\nachieving superb efficiency. The combination of these two methods makes FedDHAD\nsignificantly outperform state-of-the-art solutions in terms of accuracy (up to\n6.7% higher), efficiency (up to 2.02 times faster), and computation cost (up to\n15.0% smaller).", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDHAD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e22\u5f03\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff08\u975eIID\uff09\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFedDH\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\uff0cFedAD\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "FedDHAD\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53476.7%\uff09\u3001\u6548\u7387\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u5feb2.02\u500d\uff09\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u964d\u4f4e15.0%\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDHAD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

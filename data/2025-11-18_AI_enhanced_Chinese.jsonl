Existing test strategies, including histogram-based approaches, sine wave testing, and model-driven reconstruction, often rely on dense data acquisition followed by offline post-processing, which increases overall test time and complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive approach that utilizes an iterative behavioral model refined by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) in real time, enabling direct estimation of capacitor mismatch parameters that determine INL behavior. Our algorithm dynamically selects measurement points based on current model uncertainty, maximizing information gain with respect to parameter confidence and narrowing sampling intervals as estimation progresses. By providing immediate feedback and adaptive targeting, the proposed method eliminates the need for large-scale data collection and post-measurement analysis.

UGLMS is a closed-loop test strategy that adaptively selects SAR ADC code edges based on model uncertainty and refines a behavioral mismatch model in real time via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), eliminating full-range sweeps and offline post-processing. We introduce an enhanced UGLMS that delivers significantly faster test runtimes while maintaining estimation accuracy. First, a rank-1 EKF update replaces costly matrix inversions with efficient vector operations, and a measurement-aligned covariance-inflation strategy accelerates convergence under unexpected innovations. Second, we extend the static mismatch model with a low-order carrier polynomial to capture systematic nonlinearities beyond pure capacitor mismatch. Third, a trace-based termination adapts test length to convergence, preventing premature stops and redundant iterations. Simulations show the enhanced UGLMS reconstructs full Integral- and Differential-Non-Linearity (INL/DNL) in just 36 ms for 16-bit and under 70 ms for 18-bit ADCs (120 ms with the polynomial extension). Combining the faster convergence from covariance inflation with reduced per-iteration runtime from the rank-1 EKF update, the method reaches equal accuracy 8x faster for 16-bit ADCs.

Existing video generation models are predominantly based on the video diffusion transformer (vDiT), however, they suffer from substantial inference delay due to self-attention. While prior studies have focused on reducing redundant computations in self-attention, they often overlook the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in video streams and directly leverage sparsity patterns from large language models to reduce attention computations.\n  In this work, we take a principled approach to accelerate self-attention in vDiTs by leveraging the spatio-temporal correlations in the latent space. We show that the attention patterns within vDiT are primarily due to the dominant spatial and temporal correlations at the token channel level. Based on this insight, we propose a lightweight and adaptive reuse strategy that approximates attention computations by reusing partial attention scores of spatially or temporally correlated tokens along individual channels. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher computational savings (85\\%) compared to state-of-the-art techniques over 4 vDiTs, while preserving almost identical video quality ($<$0.06\\% loss on VBench).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173token\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668(vDiT)\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173token\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u57284\u4e2avDiT\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701(85%)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf(VBench\u4e0a\u635f\u5931<0.06%)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u4e86vDiT\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

They alleviate power and latency bottlenecks caused by extensive data movements between compute and storage units. This work proposes a digital CIM macro to compute Transformer attention. To mitigate dynamic matrix multiplication that is unsuitable for the common weight-stationary CIM paradigm, we reformulate the attention score computation process based on a combined QK-weight matrix, so that inputs can be directly fed to CIM cells to obtain the score results. Moreover, the involved binomial matrix multiplication operation is decomposed into 4 groups of bit-serial shifting and additions, without costly physical multipliers in the CIM. We maximize the energy efficiency of the CIM circuit through zero-value bit-skipping, data-driven word line activation, read-write separate 6T cells and bit-alternating 14T/28T adders. The proposed CIM macro was implemented using a 65-nm process. It occupied only 0.35 mm2 area, and delivered a 42.27 GOPS peak performance with 1.24 mW power consumption at a 1.0 V power supply and a 100 MHz clock frequency, resulting in 34.1 TOPS/W energy efficiency and 120.77 GOPS/mm2 area efficiency.

Functions that encapsulate collective operations, despite being called per-thread, must be executed cooperatively by groups of threads.\n  In this work, we introduce Prism, a new GPU language that restores modularity while still giving programmers the low-level control over collective operations necessary for high performance. Our core idea is typed perspectives, which materialize, at the type level, the granularity at which the programmer is controlling the behavior of threads. We describe the design of Prism, implement a compiler for it, and lay its theoretical foundations in a core calculus called Bundl. We implement state-of-the-art GPU kernels in Prism and find that it offers programmers the safety guarantees needed to confidently write modular code without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Prism\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u5728\u7c7b\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u4f53\u73b0\u7ebf\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e2a\u4f53\u7ebf\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5355\u4e2a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u591a\u4e2a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u534f\u540c\u6267\u884c\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982Tensor Core\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f20\u529b\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7f16\u7a0b\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u5c01\u88c5\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u867d\u7136\u6309\u7ebf\u7a0b\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5fc5\u987b\u7531\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7ec4\u534f\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Prism\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff08typed perspectives\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7c7b\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u4f53\u73b0\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u63a7\u5236\u7ebf\u7a0b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Prism\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u6f14\u7b97Bundl\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "result": "\u5728Prism\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GPU\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Prism\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4fe1\u5730\u7f16\u5199\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Prism\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\u6062\u590d\u4e86GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u96c6\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Existing research enhances GNN co-inference by leveraging offline model splitting and pipeline parallelism (PP), which enables more efficient computation and resource utilization during inference. However, the performance of these static deployment methods is significantly affected by environmental dynamics such as network fluctuations and multi-device access, which remain unaddressed. We present ACE-GNN, the first Adaptive GNN Co-inference framework tailored for dynamic Edge environments, to boost system performance and stability. ACE-GNN achieves performance awareness for complex multi-device access edge systems via system-level abstraction and two novel prediction methods, enabling rapid runtime scheme optimization. Moreover, we introduce a data parallelism (DP) mechanism in the runtime optimization space, enabling adaptive scheduling between PP and DP to leverage their distinct advantages and maintain stable system performance. Also, an efficient batch inference strategy and specialized communication middleware are implemented to further improve performance.

Inference, particularly the decoding phase, is dominated by memory-bound GEMV or flat GEMM operations with low operational intensity (OI), making it well-suited for processing-in-memory (PIM) approaches. However, existing in/near-memory solutions face critical limitations such as reduced memory capacity due to the high area cost of integrating processing elements (PEs) within DRAM chips, and limited PE capability due to the constraints of DRAM fabrication technology. This work presents a chiplet-based memory module that addresses these limitations by decoupling logic and memory into chiplets fabricated in heterogeneous technology nodes and connected via an interposer. The logic chiplets sustain high bandwidth access to the DRAM chiplets, which house the memory banks, and enable the integration of advanced processing components such as systolic arrays and SRAM-based buffers to accelerate memory-bound GEMM kernels, capabilities that were not feasible in prior PIM architectures. We propose Sangam, a CXL-attached PIM-chiplet based memory module that can either act as a drop-in replacement for GPUs or co-executes along side the GPUs.

Efficient solutions to this problem are critical, since the executable specifications used by PBT often have preconditions that input values must satisfy in order to be valid test cases, and satisfying values are often sparsely distributed.\n  We propose a novel approach to this problem using ideas from deductive program synthesis. We present a set of synthesis rules, based on a denotational semantics of generators, that give rise to an automatic procedure for synthesizing correct generators. Our system handles recursive predicates by rewriting them as catamorphisms and then matching with appropriate anamorphisms; this is theoretically simpler than other approaches to synthesis for recursive functions, yet still extremely expressive.\n  Our implementation, Palamedes, is an extensible library for the Lean theorem prover. The synthesis algorithm itself is built on standard proof-search tactics, reducing implementation burden and allowing the algorithm to benefit from further advances in Lean proof automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f14\u7ece\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6307\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u9012\u5f52\u8c13\u8bcd\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7catamorphisms\u548canamorphisms\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u503c\u7684\u8c13\u8bcd\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u6ee1\u8db3\u8be5\u8c13\u8bcd\u7684\u6240\u6709\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9PBT\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u524d\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u89c4\u8303\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6307\u79f0\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5408\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u8c13\u8bcd\u91cd\u5199\u4e3acatamorphisms\u5e76\u4e0e\u9002\u5f53\u7684anamorphisms\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u7efc\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aPalamedes\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55Lean\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u5e93\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bc1\u660e\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u4e0a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u80fd\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8eLean\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditional centralized algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, are computationally intensive and ill-suited for dynamic, distributed IoT environments. We propose a novel distributed Q-learning framework for constructing shortest-path trees (SPTs), enabling sensor nodes to independently learn optimal next-hop decisions using only local information. States are defined based on node positions and routing history, with a reward function that incentivizes progression toward the sink while penalizing inefficient paths. Trained on diverse network topologies, the framework generalizes effectively to unseen networks. Simulations across 100 to 500 nodes demonstrate near-optimal routing accuracy (over 99% for networks with more than 300 nodes), with minor deviations (1-2 extra hops) in smaller networks having negligible impact on performance. Compared to centralized and flooding-based methods, our approach reduces communication overhead, adapts to topology changes, and enhances scalability and energy efficiency.

As a result, high-end processors typically feature lower memory bandwidth per core, at the detriment of memory-intensive workloads. We propose alleviating this challenge by improving the utility of the CPU's limited pins. In a typical CPU design process, the available pins are apportioned between memory and I/O traffic, each accounting for about half of the total off-chip bandwidth availability. Consequently, unless both memory and I/O are simultaneously highly utilized, such fragmentation leads to underutilization of the valuable off-chip bandwidth resources. An ideal architecture would offer I/O and memory bandwidth fungibility, allowing use of the aggregate off-chip bandwidth in the form required by each workload.\n  In this work, we introduce SURGE, a software-supported architectural technique that boosts memory bandwidth availability by salvaging idle I/O bandwidth resources.

This paper presents the first empirical study investigating divergence in machine learning model across heterogeneous AI accelerators. Utilizing an automated pipeline, we synthesize over 100,000 variant models derived from 4,000 real-world models and execute them across five different enterprise-grade accelerators. Our findings suggest that newer AI platforms from Mac and Huawei support at least 17\\% fewer operators than NVIDIA. These platforms also exhibit a higher rate of output discrepancies (exceeding 5\\%), which stem from differences in operator implementations, handling of exceptional numerical values, and instruction scheduling.

This paper presents FERMI-ML, a Flexible and Resource-Efficient Memory-In-Situ (MIS) SRAM macro designed for TinyML acceleration. The proposed 9T XNOR-based RX9T bit-cell integrates a 5T storage cell with a 4T XNOR compute unit, enabling variable-precision MAC and CAM operations within the same array. A 22-transistor (C22T) compressor-tree-based accumulator facilitates logarithmic 1-64-bit MAC computation with reduced delay and power compared to conventional adder trees. The 4 KB macro achieves dual functionality for in-situ computation and CAM-based lookup operations, supporting Posit-4 or FP-4 precision. Post-layout results at 65 nm show operation at 350 MHz with 0.9 V, delivering a throughput of 1.93 TOPS and an energy efficiency of 364 TOPS/W, while maintaining a Quality-of-Result (QoR) above 97.5% with InceptionV4 and ResNet-18.

Based on this formulation, we develop a unified framework that unifies LLM-based generation with syntactic and semantic validation and a quantitative cost-guided feedback mechanism.

SynapticCore-X demonstrates that energy-efficient NPU-like acceleration can be prototyped on commodity educational FPGAs, lowering the entry barrier for academic and open-hardware research in neural microarchitectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SynapticCore-X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672cFPGA\u5e73\u53f0\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86RISC-V\u63a7\u5236\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b8c\u5168\u5f00\u6e90\u7684SystemVerilog\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u91cf\u7ea7IP\u5757\uff0cSynapticCore-X\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u672f\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u786c\u4ef6\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5165\u95e8\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210RV32IMC RISC-V\u63a7\u5236\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u878d\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u3001\u6682\u5b58\u5668\u5185\u5b58\u6df1\u5ea6\u548cDMA\u7a81\u53d1\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Zynq-7020\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0100MHz\u65f6\u5e8f\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ec5\u6d88\u80176.1% LUTs\u300132.5% DSPs\u548c21.4% BRAMs\u3002PYNQ-Z2\u786c\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5bc4\u5b58\u5668\u7ea7\u6267\u884c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u8def\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5468\u671f\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SynapticCore-X\u8bc1\u660e\u7c7b\u4f3cNPU\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5546\u7528\u6559\u80b2FPGA\u4e0a\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5165\u95e8\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

We then use this greedy solution as the starting point for a simulated annealing local search: we attempt vertex removals and exchanges and accept worsening moves with decaying probability, in order to escape local minima while preserving domination.\n  Our best-performing component, which we ultimately submitted, is \\texttt{hedom5}. The design of \\texttt{hedom5} is inspired by recent iterative-greedy style domination heuristics~\\cite{IterativeGreedy22} that alternate between constructive steps, pruning, and focused repair rather than relying on a single pass. In \\texttt{hedom5}, the input graph is first stored in a compact CSR structure and simplified using fast reductions such as forcing neighbors of leaves and handling isolates. We then run a lazy gain-based greedy stage using a priority queue: each candidate vertex is scored by how many currently undominated vertices its closed neighborhood would newly dominate, and scores are only recomputed when necessary. After this constructive phase, we perform an aggressive backward pruning pass that iterates over the chosen dominators in reverse insertion order and deletes any vertex whose closed neighborhood is still fully dominated by the remaining set. Finally, we run a budgeted 1-swap local improvement step that attempts to replace a dominator by an alternative vertex that covers all of its uniquely covered vertices, thereby reducing the size of the dominating set. A brief safety patch at the end guarantees full domination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5greedy-ln\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684hedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002hedom5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5728PACE 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7ecf\u5178\u7684NP\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002PACE 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e3a\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8d5b\u9053\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "hedom5\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u56fe\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7b80\u5316\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u961f\u5217\u7684\u61d2\u60f0\u589e\u76ca\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\uff1b3) \u53cd\u5411\u63d2\u5165\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u526a\u679d\uff1b4) \u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u76841-\u4ea4\u6362\u5c40\u90e8\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b5) \u6700\u7ec8\u5b89\u5168\u8865\u4e01\u786e\u4fdd\u5b8c\u5168\u652f\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728PACE 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0chedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fed\u4ee3\u8d2a\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u9020\u3001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u5c0f\u652f\u914d\u96c6\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0chedom5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

The problem is exacerbated in autoregressive (AR) LLM inference, where per-token forward passes repeatedly generate bulky intermediate features (IFs). We introduce SLICER, a retraining-free, architecture-agnostic framework that compresses IFs to reduce both communication and server load in split computing. SLICER combines (i) asymmetric top-K filtering (ATKF) to sparsify low-magnitude activations, (ii) magnitude-splitting (MS) to group the remaining non-zeros into equal-cardinality blocks, and (iii) adaptive bit quantization (ABQ) that selects per-block bitwidths under a distortion budget. Across standard vision and LLM workloads (e.g., ImageNet/COCO; HellaSwag, PIQA, ARC-E/C, GSM8K, HumanEval), SLICER reduces uplink volume by up to 10x and server GPU time by up to 4.4x, while keeping task quality within ~0-3 pp of baseline. In multi-device settings and AR LLMs, SLICER scales by shifting meaningful compute to the edge and lowering bits-per-token and server time per token, stabilizing per-step traffic. The codec attaches to off-the-shelf models without retraining or architectural changes, offering a plug-and-play path to scalable, low-latency distributed inference.

However, existing solutions struggle to achieve high frame rates, especially for high-resolution rendering. Our analysis identifies the sorting stage in the 3DGS rendering pipeline as the major bottleneck due to its high memory bandwidth demand. This paper presents Neo, which introduces a reuse-and-update sorting algorithm that exploits temporal redundancy in Gaussian ordering across consecutive frames, and devises a hardware accelerator optimized for this algorithm. By efficiently tracking and updating Gaussian depth ordering instead of re-sorting from scratch, Neo significantly reduces redundant computations and memory bandwidth pressure. Experimental results show that Neo achieves up to 10.0x and 5.6x higher throughput than state-of-the-art edge GPU and ASIC solution, respectively, while reducing DRAM traffic by 94.5% and 81.3%.

Published in Research in Academic Engineering Journal (RAEJ), 2025", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for their reasoning capabilities, yet their ability to perform structured, constraint-based optimization from natural language remains insufficiently understood. This study evaluates twenty-one publicly available LLMs on a representative heterogeneous high-performance computing (HPC) workload mapping and scheduling problem. Each model received the same textual description of system nodes, task requirements, and scheduling constraints, and was required to assign tasks to nodes, compute the total makespan, and explain its reasoning. A manually derived analytical optimum of nine hours and twenty seconds served as the ground truth reference. Three models exactly reproduced the analytical optimum while satisfying all constraints, twelve achieved near-optimal results within two minutes of the reference, and six produced suboptimal schedules with arithmetic or dependency errors. All models generated feasible task-to-node mappings, though only about half maintained strict constraint adherence. Nineteen models produced partially executable verification code, and eighteen provided coherent step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating strong interpretability even when logical errors occurred. Overall, the results define the current capability boundary of LLM reasoning in combinatorial optimization: leading models can reconstruct optimal schedules directly from natural language, but most still struggle with precise timing, data transfer arithmetic, and dependency enforcement. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as explainable co-pilots for optimization and decision-support tasks rather than autonomous solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f3021\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00LLM\u5728HPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b03\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c12\u4e2a\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c6\u4e2a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002LLM\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8ba921\u4e2aLLM\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u7684HPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5206\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u5230\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u603b\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u624b\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u76849\u5c0f\u65f620\u79d2\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "3\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c12\u4e2a\u57282\u5206\u949f\u5185\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c6\u4e2a\u5b58\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u7ea6\u675f\u300219\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c18\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u5148LLM\u80fd\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u91cd\u5efa\u6700\u4f18\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6570\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u65f6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u56f0\u96be\u3002LLM\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002"}}

However, challenges remain in ensuring the quality of Verilog generation. Complex designs often fail in a single generation due to the lack of targeted decoupling strategies, and evaluating the correctness of decoupled sub-tasks remains difficult. While the chain-of-thought (CoT) method is commonly used to improve LLM reasoning, it has been largely ineffective in automating IC design workflows, requiring manual intervention. The key issue is controlling CoT reasoning direction and step granularity, which do not align with expert RTL design knowledge. This paper introduces VeriBToT, a specialized LLM reasoning paradigm for automated Verilog generation. By integrating Top-down and design-for-verification (DFV) approaches, VeriBToT achieves self-decoupling and self-verification of intermediate steps, constructing a Backtrack Tree of Thought with formal operators. Compared to traditional CoT paradigms, our approach enhances Verilog generation while optimizing token costs through flexible modularity, hierarchy, and reusability.", "AI": {"tldr": "VeriBToT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316Verilog\u751f\u6210\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u548c\u9762\u5411\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u81ea\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316IC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236CoT\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6RTL\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210Top-down\u548cdesign-for-verification\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6709\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u56de\u6eaf\u601d\u7ef4\u6811\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u5f3aVerilog\u751f\u6210\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4e86token\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "VeriBToT\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316Verilog\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728IC\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Their ability to implement parallel pipelines for convolutions, attention mechanisms, and post-processing with deterministic timing and reduced power consumption makes them a strategic option for workloads that demand predictable performance and deep customization.\n  Unlike CPUs and GPUs, whose architecture is immutable, an FPGA can be reconfigured in the field to adapt its physical structure to a specific model, integrate as a SoC with embedded processors, and run inference near the sensor without sending raw data to the cloud.

As weathering depends on many factors, it is also difficult to link its progression to climatic changes. To predict weathering, it is essential to gather climatic data while simultaneously monitoring the progression of deterioration. The multimodal nature of collected data (images, text{\\ldots}) makes correlations difficult, particularly on different time scales. To address this issue, the COLISEUM project proposes a methodology for collecting data in three French sites to predict heritage material behaviour using artificial intelligence computer models. Over time, prediction models will allow the prediction of future material behaviours using known data from different climate change scenarios by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Thus, a climate monitoring methodology has been set up in three cultural sites in France: Notre-Dame cathedral in Strasbourg ( 67), Bibracte archaeological site (71), and the Saint-Pierre chapel in Villefranche-sur-Mer (06). Each site has a different climate and specific materials. In situ, microclimatic sensors continuously record variations parameters over time. The state of alteration is monitored at regular intervals by means of chemical analyses, cartographic measurements and scientific imaging campaigns. To implement weathering models, data is gathered in alteration matrix by mean of a calculated weathering index.

DIAP introduces a zero-dependency ZKP deployment model through a universal proof manager and compile-time build script that embeds a precompiled Noir circuit, eliminating the need for external ZKP toolchains.

Results show that Jetson Orin Nano with GPU acceleration achieves the highest energy-to-performance ratio, significantly outperforming CPU-based setups. Llama 3.2 provides the best balance of accuracy and power efficiency, while TinyLlama is well-suited for low-power environments at the cost of reduced accuracy.

This \"one-policy-fits-all\" approach leads to significant compromises in fairness, throughput, and latency, particularly with the rise of heterogeneous hardware and varied application architectures.\n  This paper proposes a new paradigm: dynamically selecting the optimal policy from a portfolio of specialized schedulers rather than designing a single, monolithic one. We present the Adaptive Scheduling Agent (ASA), a lightweight framework that intelligently matches workloads to the most suitable \"expert\" scheduling policy at runtime. ASA's core is a novel, low-overhead offline/online approach. First, an offline process trains a universal, hardware-agnostic machine learning model to recognize abstract workload patterns from system behaviors. Second, at runtime, ASA continually processes the model's predictions using a time-weighted probability voting algorithm to identify the workload, then makes a scheduling decision by consulting a pre-configured, machine-specific mapping table to switch to the optimal scheduler via Linux's sched_ext framework. This decoupled architecture allows ASA to adapt to new hardware platforms rapidly without expensive retraining of the core recognition model.\n  Our evaluation, based on a novel benchmark focused on user-experience metrics, demonstrates that ASA consistently outperforms the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF), achieving superior results in 86.4% of test scenarios.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight compression framework that leverages Range Asymmetric Numeral Systems (rANS) encoding with asymmetric integer quantization and sparse tensor representation to reduce transmission overhead dramatically. Specifically, our approach combines asymmetric integer quantization with a sparse representation technique, eliminating the need for complex probability modeling or network modifications. The key contributions include: (1) a distribution-agnostic compression pipeline that exploits inherent tensor sparsity to achieve bandwidth reduction with minimal computational overhead; (2) an approximate theoretical model that optimizes tensor reshaping dimensions to maximize compression efficiency; and (3) a GPU-accelerated implementation with sub-millisecond encoding/decoding latency. Extensive evaluations across diverse neural architectures (ResNet, VGG16, MobileNetV2, SwinT, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0) demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently maintains near-baseline accuracy across CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks. Moreover, we validated the framework's effectiveness on advanced natural language processing tasks by employing Llama2 7B and 13B on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC, PIQA, Winogrande, BoolQ, and OpenBookQA, demonstrating its broad applicability beyond computer vision.

To solve these problems, recent research has focused on constructing cloud-edge consortia that integrate server-based LLM with small language models (SLMs) on mobile edge devices. Furthermore, designing collaborative training mechanisms within such consortia to enhance inference performance has emerged as a promising research direction. However, the cross-domain deployment of SLMs, coupled with structural heterogeneity in SLMs architectures, poses significant challenges to enhancing model performance. To this end, we propose Co-PLMs, a novel co-tuning framework for collaborative training of large and small language models, which integrates the process of structure-agnostic mutual learning to realize knowledge exchange between the heterogeneous language models. This framework employs distilled proxy models (DPMs) as bridges to enable collaborative training between the heterogeneous server-based LLM and on-device SLMs, while preserving the domain-specific insights of each device.

Despite the computation and communication efficiency of these systems, due to limited computation resources on edge devices, relying on more computationally rich systems on the cloud side is inevitable in most cases. Cloud inference systems can achieve the best performance while the computation and communication cost is dramatically increasing by the expansion of a number of edge devices relying on these systems. Hence, there is a trade-off between the computation, communication, and performance of these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, dubbed as Eccentric that learns models with different levels of trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. This framework, based on an adaptation of knowledge from the edge model to the cloud one, reduces the computation and communication costs of the system during inference while achieving the best performance possible. The Eccentric framework can be considered as a new form of compression method suited for edge-cloud inference systems to reduce both computation and communication costs.

To meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, existing LLM serving systems disaggregate the prefill and decode phases of inference. However, decode instances often experience low GPU utilization due to their memory-bound nature and insufficient batching in dynamic workloads, leaving compute resources underutilized.\n  We introduce Harli, a serving system that improves GPU utilization by co-locating parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) tasks with LLM decode instances. PEFT tasks are compute-bound and memory-efficient, making them ideal candidates for safe co-location. Specifically, Harli addresses key challenges--limited memory and unpredictable interference--using three components: a unified memory allocator for runtime memory reuse, a two-stage latency predictor for decode latency modeling, and a QoS-guaranteed throughput-maximizing scheduler for throughput maximization. Experimental results show that Harli improves the finetune throughput by 46.2% on average (up to 92.0%) over state-of-the-art serving systems, while maintaining strict QoS guarantees for inference decode.", "AI": {"tldr": "Harli\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03(PEFT)\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0eLLM\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5171\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8bGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7531\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u7279\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u6279\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caQoS\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHarli\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8646.2%\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe92.0%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u4e25\u683cQoS\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Harli\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5171\u540c\u90e8\u7f72PEFT\u4efb\u52a1\u548cLLM\u89e3\u7801\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While effective in centralized systems, its behavior in decentralized settings, where network latency often dominates compute, remains under-characterized. We present Decentralized Speculative Decoding (DSD), a plug-and-play framework for decentralized inference that turns communication delay into useful computation by verifying multiple candidate tokens in parallel across distributed nodes. We further introduce an adaptive speculative verification strategy that adjusts acceptance thresholds by token-level semantic importance, delivering an additional 15% to 20% end-to-end speedup without retraining. In theory, DSD reduces cross-node communication cost by approximately (N-1)t1(k-1)/k, where t1 is per-link latency and k is the average number of tokens accepted per round. In practice, DSD achieves up to 2.56x speedup on HumanEval and 2.59x on GSM8K, surpassing the Eagle3 baseline while preserving accuracy.

While manageable in small labs, such variability can escalate into serious risks at larger scales, such as architectural 3D printing, where noise may cause structural or economic failures. This contribution presents a noise-aware decision-making algorithm that quantifies and models device-specific noise profiles to manage variability adaptively. It uses distributional analysis and pairwise divergence metrics with clustering to choose between single-device and robust multi-device Bayesian optimization strategies. Unlike conventional methods that assume homogeneous devices or generic robustness, this framework explicitly leverages inter-device differences to enhance performance, reproducibility, and efficiency. An experimental case study involving three nominally identical 3D printers (same brand, model, and close serial numbers) demonstrates reduced redundancy, lower resource usage, and improved reliability.

Given a batch of tasks each requesting one or more data items, where both tasks and data are distributed across multiple machines, each task must get co-located with its target data (by moving tasks and/or data) and executed. We present TD-Orch, an efficient and scalable orchestration framework featuring a simple application developer interface. TD-Orch employs a distributed push-pull technique, leveraging the bidirectional f low of both tasks and data to achieve scalable load balance across machines even under highly skewed data request (data hot spots), with minimal communication overhead. Experimental results show that TD-Orch achieves up to 2.7x speedup over existing distributed scheduling baselines.

Under review", "summary": "Smart cities and pervasive IoT deployments have generated interest in IoT data analysis across transportation and urban planning. At the same time, Large Language Models offer a new interface for exploring IoT data - particularly through natural language. Users today face two key challenges when working with IoT data using LLMs: (1) data collection infrastructure is expensive, producing terabytes of low-level sensor readings that are too granular for direct use, and (2) data analysis is slow, requiring iterative effort and technical expertise. Directly feeding all IoT telemetry to LLMs is impractical due to finite context windows, prohibitive token costs at scale, and non-interactive latencies. What is missing is a system that first parses a user's query to identify the analytical task, then selects the relevant data slices, and finally chooses the right representation before invoking an LLM.\n  We present Flash-Fusion, an end-to-end edge-cloud system that reduces the IoT data collection and analysis burden on users. Two principles guide its design: (1) edge-based statistical summarization (achieving 73.5% data reduction) to address data volume, and (2) cloud-based query planning that clusters behavioral data and assembles context-rich prompts to address data interpretation. We deploy Flash-Fusion on a university bus fleet and evaluate it against a baseline that feeds raw data to a state-of-the-art LLM. Flash-Fusion achieves a 95% latency reduction and 98% decrease in token usage and cost while maintaining high-quality responses.

KVSwap leverages the observation that only a small, dynamically changing subset of KV entries is critical for generation. It stores the full cache on disk, uses a compact in-memory metadata to predict which entries to preload, overlaps computation with hardware-aware disk access, and orchestrates read patterns to match storage device characteristics.

As of now, the academic community has rigorously verified the number of solutions only up to N <= 26. In 2016, the research team led by PreuBer solved the 27-Queens problem using FPGA hardware, which took approximately one year, though the result remains unverified independently. Recent studies on GPU parallel computing suggest that verifying the 27-Queens solution would still require about 17 months, indicating excessively high time and computational resource costs. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative parallel computing method on NVIDIA GPU platform, with the following core contributions: (1) An iterative depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for solving the N-Queens problem; (2) Complete mapping of the required stack structure to GPU shared memory; (3) Effective avoidance of bank conflicts through meticulously designed memory access patterns; (4) Various optimization techniques are employed to achieve optimal performance. Under the proposed optimization framework, we successfully verified the 27-Queens problem in just 28.4 days using eight RTX 5090 GPUs, thereby confirming the correctness of PreuBer's computational results. Moreover, we have reduced the projected solving time for the next open case-the 28-Queens problem-to approximately 11 months, making its resolution computationally feasible. Compared to the state-of-the-art GPU methods, our method achieves over 10x speedup on identical hardware configurations (8 A100), while delivering over 26x acceleration when utilizing 8 RTX 5090 GPUs, and brings fresh perspectives to this long-stagnant problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684GPU\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57288\u5757RTX 5090 GPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u752828.4\u5929\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8627\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8610-26\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "N\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u6570\u5177\u6709\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u4ec5\u4e25\u683c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5230N<=26\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc127\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u7ea617\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5728NVIDIA GPU\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8fed\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5c06\u6808\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u5168\u6620\u5c04\u5230GPU\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5f0f\u907f\u514dbank\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc127\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u4ec5\u970028.4\u5929\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86PreuBer\u56e2\u961f\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5c0628\u7687\u540e\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9884\u8ba1\u6c42\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u7ea611\u4e2a\u6708\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709GPU\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b010\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RTX 5090 GPU\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b026\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u957f\u671f\u505c\u6ede\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In Spark, practitioners typically rely on the Greenwald-Khanna (GK) Sketch, an approximate method. When exact quantiles are required, the default option is an expensive global sort. We present GK Select, an exact Spark algorithm that avoids full-data shuffles and completes in a constant number of actions. GK Select leverages GK Sketch to identify a near-target pivot, extracts all values within the error bound around this pivot in each partition in linear time, and then tree-reduces the resulting candidate sets. We show analytically that GK Select matches the executor-side time complexity of GK Sketch while returning the exact quantile. Empirically, GK Select achieves sketch-level latency and outperforms Spark's full sort by approximately 10.5x on 10^9 values across 120 partitions on a 30-core AWS EMR cluster.", "AI": {"tldr": "GK Select\u662fSpark\u4e2d\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6d17\u724c\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u6570\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u6bd4Spark\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u5feb\u7ea610.5\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "Spark\u4e2d\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684GK Sketch\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u9879\u662f\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528GK Sketch\u8bc6\u522b\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u67a2\u8f74\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u533a\u4e2d\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u63d0\u53d6\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6240\u6709\u503c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6811\u5f62\u5f52\u7ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eGK Select\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5668\u7aef\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548cGK Sketch\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd4\u56de\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u3002\u572830\u6838AWS EMR\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\uff0c\u5904\u740610^9\u4e2a\u503c\u3001120\u4e2a\u5206\u533a\u65f6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u8349\u56fe\u7ea7\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u6bd4Spark\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u5feb\u7ea610.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "GK Select\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86GK Sketch\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}}

KV cache update, often implemented as allocation, copying, and in-place strided update for each generated token, incurs significant overhead. As the sequence length increases, the allocation and copy overheads dominate the performance. Alternate approaches may allocate large KV tensors upfront to enable in-place updates, but these matrices (with zero-padded rows) cause redundant computations. In this work, we propose a new KV cache allocation mechanism called Balancing Memory and Compute (BMC). BMC allocates, once every r iterations, KV tensors with r redundant rows, allowing in-place update without copy overhead for those iterations, but at the expense of a small amount of redundant computation. Second, we make an interesting observation that the extra rows allocated in the KV tensors and the resulting redundant computation can be repurposed for Speculative Decoding (SD) that improves token generation efficiency. Last, BMC represents a spectrum of design points with different values of r. To identify the best-performing design point(s), we derive a simple analytical model for BMC. The proposed BMC method achieves an average throughput acceleration of up to 3.2x over baseline HuggingFace (without SD). Importantly when we apply BMC with SD, it results in an additional speedup of up to 1.39x, over and above the speedup offered by SD. Further, BMC achieves a throughput acceleration of up to 1.36x and 2.29x over state-of-the-art inference servers vLLM and DeepSpeed, respectively. Although the BMC technique is evaluated extensively across different classes of CPUs (desktop and server class), we also evaluate the scheme with GPUs and demonstrate that it works well for GPUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBMC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u671f\u5206\u914d\u5197\u4f59\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u590d\u5236\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740GPU\u6210\u672c\u98d9\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884cLLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f20\u7edfKV\u7f13\u5b58\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u914d\u548c\u590d\u5236\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u800c\u9884\u5206\u914d\u5927\u77e9\u9635\u53c8\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBMC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u6bcfr\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5206\u914d\u5e26r\u4e2a\u5197\u4f59\u884c\u7684KV\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u539f\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u5c06\u5197\u4f59\u884c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cd\u65b0\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u8ba1\u70b9\u3002", "result": "BMC\u5728HuggingFace\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad83.2\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u4e0e\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u989d\u5916\u63d0\u4f9b1.39\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u4f18\u4e8evLLM\u548cDeepSpeed\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52301.36\u500d\u548c2.29\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "BMC\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u3002"}}

As the dimensions of the matrix grow rapidly, the computational cost increases significantly, posing a serious challenge to the efficiency of data analysis and signal processing systems,especially in time-sensitive scenarios with large-scale datasets. Although various dedicated hardware architectures have been proposed to accelerate the computation of intensive SVD, many of these designs suffer from limited scalability and high consumption of on-chip memory resources. Moreover, they typically overlook the computational and data transfer challenges associated with SVD, enabling them unsuitable for real-time processing of large-scale data stream matrices in embedded systems.

Rodriguez", "Rajkumar Buyya"], "title": "A Decentralized Root Cause Localization Approach for Edge Computing Environments", "comment": null, "summary": "Edge computing environments host increasingly complex microservice-based IoT applications, which are prone to performance anomalies that can propagate across dependent services. Identifying the true source of such anomalies, known as Root Cause Localization (RCL), is essential for timely mitigation. However, existing RCL approaches are designed for cloud environments and rely on centralized analysis, which increases latency and communication overhead when applied at the edge. This paper proposes a decentralized RCL approach that executes localization directly at the edge device level using the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm. The proposed method first groups microservices into communication- and colocation-aware clusters, thereby confining most anomaly propagation within cluster boundaries. Within each cluster, PPR is executed locally to identify the root cause, significantly reducing localization time. For the rare cases where anomalies propagate across clusters, we introduce an inter-cluster peer-to-peer approximation process, enabling lightweight coordination among clusters with minimal communication overhead. To enhance the accuracy of localization in heterogeneous edge environments, we also propose a novel anomaly scoring mechanism tailored to the diverse anomaly triggers that arise across microservice, device, and network layers. Evaluation results on the publicly available edge dataset, MicroCERCL, demonstrate that the proposed decentralized approach achieves comparable or higher localization accuracy than its centralized counterpart while reducing localization time by up to 34%. These findings highlight that decentralized graph-based RCL can provide a practical and efficient solution for anomaly diagnosis in resource-constrained edge environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5c42\u9762\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2a\u6027\u5316PageRank\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u7fa4\u5316\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e3a\u4e91\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1IoT\u5e94\u7528\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u6027\u80fd\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4e14\u5f02\u5e38\u4f1a\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u670d\u52a1\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u5171\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5f02\u5e38\u4f20\u64ad\u8303\u56f4\uff1b2. \u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u4f7f\u7528PPR\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u5730\u6267\u884c\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b3. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u96c6\u7fa4\u95f4\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u8fb9\u7f18\u6570\u636e\u96c6MicroCERCL\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bca\u65ad\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

High-performance implementations typically rely on low-level HIP/CUDA communication libraries that demand substantial engineering effort for even basic overlap patterns, while simpler abstractions often sacrifice performance. We present Iris, a multi-GPU communication library implemented entirely in Python and Triton that eliminates this trade-off. Iris provides tile-based symmetric memory abstractions that naturally align with Triton's programming model, enabling developers to write single-source kernels that seamlessly interleave computation and communication. We demonstrate a taxonomy of compute-communication overlap patterns--from bulk-synchronous to fine-grained workgroup specialization--that can be implemented with minimal code changes in Iris, often requiring just a few additional lines within the same Triton kernel. Our evaluation shows that Iris achieves near-optimal bandwidth utilization in microbenchmarks and delivers up to 1.79x speedup over PyTorch and RCCL for GEMM+All-Scatter workloads, demonstrating that high-level implementations can match or exceed heavily-optimized libraries while dramatically simplifying multi-GPU programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Iris\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u7528Python\u548cTriton\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u591aGPU\u901a\u4fe1\u5e93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7tile-based\u5bf9\u79f0\u5185\u5b58\u62bd\u8c61\u6d88\u9664\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97-\u901a\u4fe1\u91cd\u53e0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u7b80\u5316\u591aGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591aGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u5c42HIP/CUDA\u901a\u4fe1\u5e93\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5de5\u7a0b\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u62bd\u8c61\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "Iris\u63d0\u4f9btile-based\u5bf9\u79f0\u5185\u5b58\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4e0eTriton\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7f16\u5199\u5355\u6e90\u5185\u6838\u65e0\u7f1d\u4ea4\u7ec7\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecebulk-synchronous\u5230\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6workgroup\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aIris\u5728\u5fae\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5728GEMM+All-Scatter\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u6bd4PyTorch\u548cRCCL\u5feb\u8fbe1.79\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5e93\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u7b80\u5316\u591aGPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u3002"}}

To improve energy efficiency, gaining process-level insights into energy consumption is essential. While node-level energy consumption data can be directly measured with hardware such as power meters, existing mechanisms for estimating per-process energy usage, such as Intel RAPL, are limited to specific hardware and provide only coarse-grained, domain-level measurements. Our proposed approach models per-process energy profiles by leveraging fine-grained process-level resource metrics collected via eBPF and perf, which are synchronized with node-level energy measurements obtained from an attached power distribution unit. By statistically learning the relationship between process-level resource usage and node-level energy consumption through a regression-based model, our approach enables more fine-grained per-process energy predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eeBPF\u548cperf\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u80fd\u8017\u56e0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\u548cAI\u9700\u6c42\u6fc0\u589e\u800c\u6025\u5267\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u6d1e\u5bdf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Intel RAPL\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u57df\u7ea7\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528eBPF\u548cperf\u6536\u96c6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u6765\u81eaPDU\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u6d4b\u91cf\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u7ea7\u80fd\u8017\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u80fd\u6548\u3002"}}

Conventional optimization techniques struggle to respond effectively under dynamic edge conditions and high user loads. In this study, we explore a slice-enabled in-network edge architecture that combines computing-in-the-network (COIN) with multi-access edge computing (MEC). In addition, we formulate the joint problem of wireless and computing resource management with optimal slice selection as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). Because solving this model online is computationally intensive, we decompose it into three sub-problems (SP1) intra-slice allocation, (SP2) inter-slice allocation, and (SP3) offloading decision and train a distributed hierarchical DeepSets-based model (DeepSets-S) on optimal solutions obtained offline. In the proposed model, we design a slack-aware normalization mechanism for a shared encoder and task-specific decoders, ensuring permutation equivariance over variable-size wireless device (WD) sets. The learned system produces near-optimal allocations with low inference time and maintains permutation equivariance over variable-size device sets. Our experimental results show that DeepSets-S attains high tolerance-based accuracies on SP1/SP2 (Acc1 = 95.26% and 95.67%) and improves multiclass offloading accuracy on SP3 (Acc = 0.7486; binary local/offload Acc = 0.8824). Compared to exact solvers, the proposed approach reduces the execution time by 86.1%, while closely tracking the optimal system cost (within 6.1% in representative regimes).

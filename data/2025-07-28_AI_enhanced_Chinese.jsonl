Recently, the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as\nan efficient alternative, promising efficient inference with less activated\nweights per token. Nevertheless, fine-grained MoE-based LLMs face several\nchallenges: 1) Variable workloads during runtime create arbitrary GEMV-GEMM\nratios that reduce hardware utilization, 2) Traditional MoE-based scheduling\nfor LLM serving cannot fuse attention operations with MoE operations, leading\nto increased latency and decreased hardware utilization, and 3) Despite being\nmore efficient than conventional LLMs, loading experts from DRAM still consumes\nsignificant energy and requires substantial DRAM bandwidth. Addressing these\nchallenges, we propose: 1) A3D-MoE, a 3D Heterogeneous Integration system that\nemploys state-of-the-art vertical integration technology to significantly\nenhance memory bandwidth while reducing Network-on-Chip (NoC) overhead and\nenergy consumption. 2) A 3D-Adaptive GEMV-GEMM-ratio systolic array with\nV-Cache efficient data reuse and a novel unified 3D dataflow to solve the\nproblem of reduced hardware utilization caused by arbitrary GEMV-GEMM ratios\nfrom different workloads, 3) A Hardware resource-aware operation fusion\nscheduler that fuses attention operations with MoE operations to enhance\nhardware performance, and 4) MoE Score-Aware HBM access reduction with even-odd\nexpert placement that reduces DRAM access and bandwidth requirements. Our\nevaluation results indicate that A3D-MoE delivers significant performance\nenhancements, reducing latency by a factor of 1.8x to 2x and energy consumption\nby 2x to 4x, while improving throughput by 1.44x to 1.8x compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faA3D-MoE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc73D\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3MoE\u67b6\u6784LLM\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u548cMoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94GEMV-GEMM\u6bd4\u9635\u5217\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u548cMoE\u5206\u6570\u611f\u77e5HBM\u8bbf\u95ee\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "result": "A3D-MoE\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.8x-2x\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u51cf\u5c112x-4x\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad81.44x-1.8x\u3002", "conclusion": "A3D-MoE\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002"}}

In this paper, we take a first step\ntowards using ACL2s to reason about Python code by developing an embedding of a\nsubset of the Python type system in ACL2s. The subset of Python types we\nsupport includes many of the most commonly used type annotations as well as\nuser-defined types comprised of supported types. We provide ACL2s definitions\nof these types, as well as defdata enumerators that are customized to provide\ncode coverage and identify errors in Python programs. Using the ACL2s\nembedding, we can generate instances of types that can then be used as inputs\nto fuzz Python programs, which allows us to identify bugs in Python code that\nare not detected by state-of-the-art Python type checkers. We evaluate our work\nagainst four open-source repositories, extracting their type information and\ngenerating inputs for fuzzing functions with type signatures that are in the\nsupported subset of Python types. Note that we only use the type signatures of\nfunctions to generate inputs and treat the bodies of functions as black boxes.\nWe measure code coverage, which ranges from about 68% to more than 80%, and\nidentify code patterns that hinder coverage such as complex branch conditions\nand external file system dependencies.

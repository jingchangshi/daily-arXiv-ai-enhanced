These substrates must operate reliably in heterogeneous and\npermissionless environments, where Network Address Translators (NATs) and\nfirewalls impose significant constraints. Existing solutions, however, are\neither designed for controlled data center deployments or implemented as\nmonolithic systems that tightly couple machine learning logic with networking\ncode. To address these limitations, we present Lattica, a decentralized\ncross-NAT communication framework designed to support distributed AI systems.\nLattica integrates three core components. First, it employs a robust suite of\nNAT traversal mechanisms to establish a globally addressable peer-to-peer mesh.\nSecond, it provides a decentralized data store based on Conflict-free\nReplicated Data Types (CRDTs), ensuring verifiable and eventually consistent\nstate replication. Third, it incorporates a content discovery layer that\nleverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) together with an optimized RPC\nprotocol for efficient model synchronization. By integrating these components,\nLattica delivers a complete protocol stack for sovereign, resilient, and\nscalable AI systems that operate independently of centralized intermediaries.\nIt is directly applicable to edge intelligence, collaborative reinforcement\nlearning, and other large-scale distributed machine learning scenarios."}

However, existing work primarily focuses\non scheduling tasks within the MoE layer, such as expert computing and\nall-to-all (A2A) communication, while neglecting other key operations including\nmulti-head attention (MHA) computing, gating, and all-reduce communication. In\nthis paper, we propose FlowMoE, a scalable framework for scheduling multi-type\ntask pipelines. First, FlowMoE constructs a unified pipeline to consistently\nscheduling MHA computing, gating, expert computing, and A2A communication.\nSecond, FlowMoE introduces a tensor chunk-based priority scheduling mechanism\nto overlap the all-reduce communication with all computing tasks. We implement\nFlowMoE as an adaptive and generic framework atop PyTorch. Extensive\nexperiments with 675 typical MoE layers and four real-world MoE models across\ntwo GPU clusters demonstrate that our proposed FlowMoE framework outperforms\nstate-of-the-art MoE training frameworks, reducing training time by 13%-57%,\nenergy consumption by 10%-39%, and memory usage by 7%-32%."}

This paper presents a Hybrid ACO-PSO (HAPSO)\nalgorithm for energy-aware virtual machine (VM) placement and migration in\ngreen cloud datacenters.

In the second stage, a discrete Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) refines allocations by migrating VMs from overloaded or underutilized\nhosts. HAPSO introduces several innovations: sequential hybridization of\nmetaheuristics, system-informed particle initialization using ACO output,\nheuristic-guided discretization for constraint handling, and a multi-objective\nfitness function that minimizes active servers and resource wastage.\nImplemented in CloudSimPlus, extensive simulations demonstrate that HAPSO\nconsistently outperforms classical heuristics (BFD, FFD), Unified Ant Colony\nSystem (UACS), and ACO-only. Notably, HAPSO achieves up to 25% lower energy\nconsumption and 18% fewer SLA violations compared to UACS at large-scale\nworkloads, while sustaining stable cost and carbon emissions.

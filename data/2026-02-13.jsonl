This work investigates whether GPT-5 can effectively acquire proficiency in an unfamiliar functional programming language, Idris, through iterative, feedback driven prompting. We first establish a baseline showing that with zero shot prompting the model solves only 22 out of 56 Idris exercises using the platform Exercism, substantially underperforming relative to higher resource languages (45 out of 50 in Python and 35 out of 47 in Erlang). We then evaluate several refinement strategies, including iterative prompting based on platform feedback, augmenting prompts with documentation and error classification guides, and iterative prompting using local compilation errors and failed test cases. Among these approaches, incorporating local compilation errors yields the most substantial improvements. Using this structured, error guided refinement loop, GPT-5 performance increased to an impressive 54 solved problems out of 56. These results suggest that while large language models may initially struggle in low resource settings, structured compiler level feedback can play a critical role in unlocking their capabilities."}

However, during expert parallel training, dynamic routing results in significant load imbalance among experts: a handful of overloaded experts hinder overall iteration, emerging as a training bottleneck.\n  In this paper, we introduce LAER-MoE, an efficient MoE training framework. The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing. In particular, we perform fine-grained scheduling of communication operations to minimize communication overhead. Additionally, we develop a load balancing planner to formulate re-layout strategies of experts and routing schemes for tokens during training. We perform experiments on an A100 cluster, and the results indicate that our system achieves up to 1.69x acceleration compared to the current state-of-the-art training systems.

Using a calibrated SPICE AFMTJ model as a baseline, we identify the limitations of conventional drivers and propose an asymmetric pulse driver (PD) for deterministic picosecond switching and a self-timed sense amplifier (STSA) with dynamic trip-point tuning for low-TMR sensing. Our experiments using SPICE and Monte Carlo evaluations demonstrate that the proposed circuits preserve AFMTJ latency and energy benefits while achieving robust read/write yield under realistic PVT and 3D integration parasitics, outperforming standard MRAM front-ends under the same conditions."}

This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case."}

The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\\left(\\left(n\\log\\log n\\log^{(3)} n\\log^{(4)} n\\cdots \\log^{(\\log^* n)} n\\right)\\cdot 2^{\\log^* n}\\right) \\le n(\\log\\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \\log n/\\log\\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\\log^2 n/\\log\\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\\log^2 n/(\\log\\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously."}

Spatially, workloads comprise heterogeneous requests with varying compute and memory demands. Temporally, workload composition varies over time. Nevertheless, existing systems typically assume spatially uniform and temporally stable workloads, employing a homogeneous, static model deployment. This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. First, OServe introduces a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments according to real-time workload characteristics. Second, OServe proposes an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes. Experiments on real-world traces show that OServe improves performance by up to 2$\\times$ (average: 1.5$\\times$) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems."}

With growing requests and context lengths, key-value (KV)-related operations, including attention computation and KV cache storage, have emerged as critical bottlenecks. They require massive memory bandwidth and capacity. Unfortunately, existing LLM serving systems, optimized for compute-bound workloads, fail to handle these memory-intensive operations effectively. Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.\n  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture. PAM introduces a novel computing paradigm to balance high memory bandwidth with scalable capacity. First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads. By addressing both bandwidth and capacity demands simultaneously, PAM significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems, paving the way for cost-effective, high-performance solutions in the era of large-scale AI."}

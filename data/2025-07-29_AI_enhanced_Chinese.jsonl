To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission\ndependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle\ncooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.\nFirst, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,\nnamely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline\nfor one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double\nDeep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and\nmulti-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment\ntime and improving adaptability over baseline methods.

This\npaper presents a direct, empirical performance analysis of matrix\nmultiplication on a modern, consumer-grade heterogeneous platform. We\nimplemented and benchmarked three versions of the algorithm: a baseline\nsequential C++ implementation, a parallel version for its multi-core CPU using\nOpenMP, and a massively parallel version for its discrete GPU using CUDA with\nshared memory optimizations. The implementations were evaluated with square\nmatrices of varying dimensions, from 128x128 to 4096x4096. Our results show\nthat while the parallel CPU provides a consistent speedup of 12-14x over the\nsequential version, the GPU's performance scales dramatically with problem\nsize. For a 4096x4096 matrix, the GPU implementation achieved a speedup of\napproximately 593x over the sequential baseline and 45x over the optimized\nparallel CPU version.

The system leverages this ontology not only to visualize programming\nconcepts but also to provide hints during practice programming exercises and\nrecommend subsequent programming concepts. The adaptive mechanism is driven by\nthe Elo Rating System, applied in an educational context to dynamically\nestimate the most appropriate exercise difficulty for each learner. An\nexperimental study compared two instructional modes, adaptive and random, based\non six features derived from 1,186 code submissions across all the experimental\ngroups.

The\nevaluation results show that the architecture can handle many parallel tracing\nsessions efficiently, although the per-session throughput decreases slightly as\nthe system load increases, while the overall throughput increases.

However, quantifying\nthese trade-offs on widely accessible hardware remains a critical area of\nstudy. This paper presents a direct, empirical measurement of the performance\nand energy-to-solution of a canonical HPC workload -- a 4096x4096 matrix-matrix\nmultiplication -- on three distinct compute architectures within a single\nconsumer-grade laptop: a multi-core AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU, a discrete NVIDIA\nGeForce GTX 1650 GPU, and an integrated AMD Radeon Vega GPU. Using standard,\nvalidated, and minimally intrusive tools such as Linux perf and nvidia-smi, we\nfind that the discrete GPU is not only the performance leader, achieving a\n93.5x speedup over the CPU, but is also the most energy-efficient, consuming\nonly 2% of the energy used by the CPU, resulting in a 50-fold improvement in\nenergy efficiency. These findings provide a practical demonstration of the\n\"race to idle\" principle and offer clear, quantitative guidance on\narchitectural choices for energy-aware software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u591a\u6838CPU\u3001\u79bb\u6563GPU\u548c\u96c6\u6210GPU\uff09\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u6563GPU\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eCPU\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u529f\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u8861\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\uff08Linux perf\u548cnvidia-smi\uff09\u6d4b\u91cf4096x4096\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\uff08AMD Ryzen CPU\u3001NVIDIA GTX GPU\u548cAMD Radeon GPU\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u79bb\u6563GPU\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534793.5\u500d\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3aCPU\u76842%\uff0c\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u534750\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u6563GPU\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Existing approaches in spatial\narchitectures such as coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) and\nfield-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) frequently rely on loop unrolling or\nGEMM-based matrix transformations, introducing significant overhead in both\ndata movement and instruction control. This paper presents a new framework\ndesigned to systematically demystify the 7-dimensional convolution loop nest by\nreinterpreting it as a hardware-centric data and instruction streaming problem.\nInstead of treating the loop nest as a fixed computational construct, our\napproach exposes its structure as a set of spatial and temporal mappings\ngoverned by hardware parameters such as compute element distribution,\ninterconnect topology, and reconfigurability. This abstraction supports\nlightweight, flexible deployment of convolution without reliance on heavyweight\ntransformations or reordering schemes. We demonstrate the application of our\napproach on the MAVeC accelerator. We detail the implementation of convolution\noperations in MAVeC and extend the framework to support full model execution on\nVGG-16. Our profiling reveals high PE utilization (over 90%), significant fold\nreuse, and scalable throughput up to 1.56 TFLOPs/sec and 12.7 KIPS for\nend-to-end VGG-16 inference.

Modern high performance\ncomputing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across\nnodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling\nand load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks\nsuch as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support\ndiverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling\nalgorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable\nalgorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.\n  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling\nalgorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across\nsix applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are\ncapable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require\nsignificant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.\nExpert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less\nexploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a\nspecific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based\nlearning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.\n  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling\nalgorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP\napplications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling\noptimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u4e13\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728OpenMP\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5e73\u8861\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002OpenMP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u63a2\u7d22\uff1b\u4e13\u5bb6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728OpenMP\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230MPI\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002"}}

This paper\nintroduces RIMMS (Runtime Integrated Memory Management System), a lightweight,\nruntime-managed, hardware-agnostic memory abstraction layer that decouples\napplication development from low-level memory operations. RIMMS transparently\ntracks data locations, manages consistency, and supports efficient memory\nallocation across heterogeneous compute elements without requiring\nplatform-specific tuning or code modifications. We integrate RIMMS into a\nbaseline runtime and evaluate with complete radar signal processing\napplications across CPU+GPU and CPU+FPGA platforms. RIMMS delivers up to 2.43X\nspeedup on GPU-based and 1.82X on FPGA-based systems over the baseline.\nCompared to IRIS, a recent heterogeneous runtime system, RIMMS achieves up to\n3.08X speedup and matches the performance of native CUDA implementations while\nsignificantly reducing programming complexity. Despite operating at a higher\nabstraction level, RIMMS incurs only 1-2 cycles of overhead per memory\nmanagement call, making it a low-cost solution.

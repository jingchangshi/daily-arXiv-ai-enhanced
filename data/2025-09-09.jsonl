These complex designs often combine\none or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in\nhardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a\nwell-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction\nlevels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be\nseamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in\nthe SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the\nSystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely,\nand would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems\nlike peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a\nversatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC\nkernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our\nextensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different\nlevels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated\nfor (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants.

One of the central challenges in designing reliable\nstream-based monitors is to deal with the asynchronous nature of data streams:\nin concrete applications, the different sensors being monitored produce values\nat different speeds, and it is the monitor's responsibility to correctly react\nto the asynchronous arrival of different streams of values.

Quantized models address memory constraints in LLMs and\nenhance GPU resource utilization through efficient GPU sharing. However,\nquantized models have smaller KV block sizes than non-quantized models, causing\nlimited memory efficiency due to memory fragmentation. Also, distinct resource\nusage patterns between quantized and non-quantized models require efficient\nscheduling to maximize throughput. To address these challenges, we propose\nFineServe, an inference serving framework for mixed-precision LLMs. FineServe's\nkey contributions include: (1) KV Slab, a precision-aware adaptive memory\nmanagement technique dynamically allocating KV cache based on model\nquantization characteristics, significantly reducing GPU memory fragmentation,\nand (2) a two-level scheduling framework comprising a global scheduler that\nplaces models to GPUs based on request rates, latency SLOs, and memory\nconstraints and efficiency, and a local scheduler that adaptively adjusts batch\nsizes according to real-time request fluctuations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FineServe achieves up to 2.2x higher SLO attainment and 1.8x\nhigher token generation throughput compared to the state-of-the-art GPU sharing\nsystems."}

These complex designs often combine\none or more processors, interconnects, and peripherals to perform tasks in\nhardware or interact with the environment. Verifying these subsystems is a\nwell-suited task for VPs, as they allow reasoning across different abstraction\nlevels. While modern verification techniques like symbolic execution can be\nseamlessly integrated into VP-based workflows, they require modifications in\nthe SystemC kernel. Hence, existing approaches therefore modify and replace the\nSystemC kernel, or ignore the opportunity of cross-level scenarios completely,\nand would not allow focusing on special challenges of particular subsystems\nlike peripherals. We propose CrosSym and SEFOS, two opposing approaches for a\nversatile symbolic execution of peripherals. CrosSym modifies the SystemC\nkernel, while SEFOS instead modifies a modern symbolic execution engine. Our\nextensive evaluation applies our tools to various peripherals on different\nlevels of abstractions. Both tools extensive sets of features are demonstrated\nfor (1) different verification scenarios, and (2) identifying 300+ mutants. In\ncomparison with each other, SEFOS convinces with the unmodified SystemC kernel\nand peripheral, while CrosSym offers slightly better runtime and memory usage.\nIn comparison to the state-of-the-art, that is limited to Transaction Level\nModelling (TLM), our tools offered comparable runtime, while enabling\ncross-level verification with symbolic execution."}

However, current LLM inference systems typically deploy instances\nof the same model with identical configurations, lacking mechanisms to leverage\nsuch heterogeneity. To fill this research gap, we propose MaaSO, the first MaaS\nOrchestrator, which comprises three modules: (1) a profiler characterizing\ninstance performance under diverse parallelism strategies and inference batch\nsizes; (2) a placer optimizing heterogeneous instance configurations; (3) a\ndistributor enabling SLO-aware request distribution and preventing cascaded\ntimeouts in continuous batching.

While modern dataflow accelerators\nincorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations,\nexisting programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively.\nLow-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant\ndevelopment overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away\ncommunication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to\nreconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded,\ntask-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data\ncommunication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write\nprograms as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded\ninputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually\nonto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a\nphysical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on\nboth AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves\nhigh performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized\ncode. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and\ndelivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art\ncommercial framework.

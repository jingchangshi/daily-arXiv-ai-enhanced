This work introduces QEIL, Quantifying Edge Intelligence via Inference time Scaling Laws, a unified framework for efficient local LLM inference using principled scaling laws and heterogeneous orchestration across CPU, GPU, and NPU accelerators. We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage. Extensive evaluation across five model families from 125M to 2.6B parameters demonstrates consistent gains, including 7 to 10.5 percentage point improvement in pass at k coverage, 35.6 to 78.2 percent energy reduction, 68 percent average power reduction enabling edge thermal budgets, 15.8 percent latency improvement, and zero accuracy loss. Results confirm that inference time scaling laws are universal and architecture agnostic, establishing heterogeneous edge orchestration as the optimal strategy for energy constrained intelligent systems."}

Our work introduces a set of hardware-aware techniques. For prefill, we introduce an efficient dequantization engine, optimize tiled matrix multiplication kernels, and propose FlowQKV, a chunked, pipelined attention mechanism. For decoding, we introduce FusedDQP, which fuses dequantization and projection into a single kernel, and FlowKV, which re-structures attention to sustain high memory bandwidth utilization. Together with a compact Q4NX 4-bit quantization format, these methods yield up to $5.2\\times$ faster prefill and $4.8\\times$ faster decoding versus the iGPU, and $33.5\\times$ and $2.2\\times$ over the CPU, respectively. Power efficiency improves by as much as $67.2\\times$ and $222.9\\times$ compared to the iGPU and CPU.

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures."}

Quantized LLMs offer significant advantages with extremely quantized models, motivating the development of specialized architectures to accelerate their workloads. This paper proposes D-Legion, a novel scalable many-core architecture, designed using many adaptive-precision systolic array cores, to accelerate matrix multiplication in quantized LLMs. The proposed architecture consists of a set of Legions where each Legion has a group of adaptive-precision systolic arrays. D-Legion supports multiple computation modes, including quantized sparse and dense matrix multiplications. The block structured sparsity is exploited within a fully-sparse, or partially-sparse windows. In addition, memory accesses of partial summations (psums) are spatially reduced through parallel accumulators. Furthermore, data reuse is maximized through optimized scheduling techniques by multicasting matrix tiles across the Legions. A comprehensive design space exploration is performed in terms of Legion/core granularity to determine the optimal Legion configuration. Moreover, D-Legion is evaluated on attention workloads from two BitNet models, delivering up to 8.2$\\times$ lower latency, up to 3.8$\\times$ higher memory savings, and up to 3$\\times$ higher psum memory savings compared to state-of-the-art work.

Traditionally, such locally optimized decisions are made by hand-coded algorithms tuned for a small number of benchmarks, often requiring significant effort to be retuned when the benchmark suite changes. In the past 20 years, Machine Learning has been employed to construct performance models to improve the selection and ordering of compiler optimizations, however, the approaches are not baked into the compiler seamlessly and never materialized to be leveraged at a fine-grained scope of code segments. This paper presents Protean Compiler: An agile framework to enable LLVM with built-in phase-ordering capabilities at a fine-grained scope. The framework also comprises a complete library of more than 140 handcrafted static feature collection methods at varying scopes, and the experimental results showcase speedup gains of up to 4.1% on average and up to 15.7% on select Cbench applications wrt LLVM's O3 by just incurring a few extra seconds of build time on Cbench. Additionally, Protean compiler allows for an easy integration with third-party ML frameworks and other Large Language Models, and this two-step optimization shows a gain of 10.1% and 8.5% speedup wrt O3 on Cbench's Susan and Jpeg applications. Protean compiler is seamlessly integrated into LLVM and can be used as a new, enhanced, full-fledged compiler. We plan to release the project to the open-source community in the near future."}

These benefits carry over into the world of formal verification. Reasoning about programs algebraically is a simple affair in a proof assistant, whereas programs with unconstrained mutation necessitate much more complex techniques, such as Separation Logic, where invariants about memory safety, aliasing, and state changes must be established by manual proof. Uniqueness type systems allow programs to be compiled to code that uses mutation for efficiency, while retaining a semantics that enjoys value independence for reasoning. The restrictions of these type systems, however, are often too onerous for realistic software. Thus, most uniqueness type systems include some \"escape hatch\" where the benefits of value independence for reasoning are lost, but the restrictions of uniqueness types are lifted. To formally verify a system with such mixed guarantees, the value independence guarantees from uniqueness types must be expressed in terms of imperative, mutable semantics. In other words, we ought to express value independence as an assertion in Separation Logic."}

Their random sparsity, however, is at odds with efficient implementations on modern GPUs, since it leads to irregular memory access patterns that degrade memory bandwidth utilization. Motivated by this tension, we pursue a sketch-kernel co-design approach: we design a new family of sparse sketches, BlockPerm-SJLT, whose sparsity structure is chosen to enable FlashSketch, a corresponding optimized CUDA kernel that implements these sketches efficiently. The design of BlockPerm-SJLT introduces a tunable parameter that explicitly trades off the tension between GPU-efficiency and sketching robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees for BlockPerm-SJLT under the oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) framework, and also analyze the effect of the tunable parameter on sketching quality. We empirically evaluate FlashSketch on standard RandNLA benchmarks, as well as an end-to-end ML data attribution pipeline called GraSS. FlashSketch pushes the Pareto frontier of sketching quality versus speed, across a range of regimes and tasks, and achieves a global geomean speedup of roughly 1.7x over the prior state-of-the-art GPU sketches."}

Real systems written in Rust rely on thousands of transitive dependencies. These dependencies are as dangerous in Rust as they are in other languages (e.g., C or JavaScript) -- and auditing these dependencies today means manually inspecting every line of code. Unlike for most industrial languages, though, we can take advantage of Rust's type and module system to minimize the amount of code that developers need to inspect to the code that is potentially dangerous. Cargo Scan models such potentially dangerous code as effects and performs a side-effects analysis, tailored to Rust, to identify effects and track them across crate and module boundaries. In most cases (69.2%) developers can inspect flagged effects and decide whether the code is potentially dangerous locally. In some cases, however, the safety of an effect depends on the calling context -- how a function is called, potentially by a crate the developer imports later. Hence, Cargo Scan tracks context-dependent information using a call-graph, and collects audit results into composable and reusable audit files. In this paper, we describe our experience auditing Rust crates with Cargo Scan. In particular, we audit the popular client and server HTTP crate, hyper, and all of its dependencies; our experience shows that Cargo Scan can reduce the auditing burden of potentially dangerous code to a median of 0.2% of lines of code when compared to auditing whole crates. Looking at the Rust ecosystem more broadly, we find that Cargo Scan can automatically classify ~3.5K of the top 10K crates on crates.io as safe; of the crates that do require manual inspection, we find that most of the potentially dangerous side-effects are concentrated in roughly 3% of these crates."}

We present PackInfer, a kernel-level attention framework that enables compute- and I/O-aware execution for heterogeneous batched inference. PackInfer orchestrates batched requests into load-balanced execution groups, effectively saturating GPU utilization by packing multiple requests into unified kernel launches. By constructing attention kernels directly over packed query-key regions, PackInfer eliminates redundant computation and balances thread-block execution. It then incorporates I/O-aware grouping that co-locates shared-prefix requests and reorganizes KV caches into group-contiguous layouts, reducing memory fragmentation and redundant data movement as generation evolves. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that PackInfer reduces inference latency by 13.0-20.1%, and improves throughput by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art FlashAttention."}

Parallelizing the fixpoint engine can significantly reduce analysis times. Previous approaches typically fix the granularity of tasks upfront, e.g., at the level of program threads or procedures - yielding an engine permanently stuck in one gear. Instead, we propose to parallelize a generic fixpoint engine in a way that is parametric in the task granularity - meaning that our engine can be run in different gears. We build on the top-down solver TD, extended with support for mixed-flow sensitivity, and realize two competing philosophies for parallelization, both building on a task pool that schedules tasks to a fixed number of workers. The nature of tasks differs between the philosophies. In the immediate approach, all tasks access a single thread-safe hash table maintaining solver state, while in the independent approach, each task has its own state and exchanges data with other tasks via a publish/subscribe data structure. We have equipped the fixpoint engine of the static analysis framework Goblint with implementations following both philosophies and report on our results for large real-world programs."}

This paper fills this research gap by experimentally comparing the performance of two server-side web application configurations: one without caching and another with in-memory caching and a fixed time-tolive. The performance evaluation was conducted using a lightweight web server framework, and response times were measured using repeated HTTP requests under identical environmental conditions.

While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%.

Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work."}

Our goal is to bring HPC-like performance and resilience to serverless and continuum environments while preserving the programmability benefits of skeletons. As a first step, we focus on the well known Farm pattern and its implementation on the open-source OpenFaaS platform, treating autoscaling of the worker pool as a QoS-aware resource management problem. The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS. In particular, we discuss the autoscaling model and its training, and evaluate two reinforcement learning (RL) policies against a baseline of reactive management derived from a simple farm performance model. Our results show that AI-based management can better accommodate platform-specific limitations than purely model-based performance steering, improving QoS while maintaining efficient resource usage and stable scaling behaviour."}

Parallelizing the fixpoint engine can significantly reduce analysis times. Previous approaches typically fix the granularity of tasks upfront, e.g., at the level of program threads or procedures - yielding an engine permanently stuck in one gear. Instead, we propose to parallelize a generic fixpoint engine in a way that is parametric in the task granularity - meaning that our engine can be run in different gears. We build on the top-down solver TD, extended with support for mixed-flow sensitivity, and realize two competing philosophies for parallelization, both building on a task pool that schedules tasks to a fixed number of workers. The nature of tasks differs between the philosophies. In the immediate approach, all tasks access a single thread-safe hash table maintaining solver state, while in the independent approach, each task has its own state and exchanges data with other tasks via a publish/subscribe data structure. We have equipped the fixpoint engine of the static analysis framework Goblint with implementations following both philosophies and report on our results for large real-world programs."}

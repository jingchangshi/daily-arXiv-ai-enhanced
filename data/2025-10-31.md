### [1] [Fair intersection of seekable iterators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26016)
*Michael Arntzenius*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 论文展示了如何通过限制工作量的公平搜索策略，在函数式语言中实现最坏情况最优连接


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 借鉴miniKanren相对于Prolog的语义进步，探索在函数式语言中实现公平且高效的搜索策略

Method: 使用有界工作量方法实现公平性，通过可搜索迭代器接口实现最坏情况最优连接

Result: 开发了一种优雅的组合方法，适用于函数式语言的浅层嵌入

Conclusion: 有界工作量的公平性概念不仅适用于逻辑编程，也能优雅地应用于实现数据库连接算法

Abstract: miniKanren's key semantic advance over Prolog is to implement a complete yet
efficient search strategy, fairly interleaving execution between disjuncts.
This fairness is accomplished by bounding how much work is done exploring one
disjunct before switching to the next. We show that the same idea -- fairness
via bounded work -- underlies an elegant compositional approach to implementing
worst-case optimal joins using a seekable iterator interface, suitable for
shallow embedding in functional languages.

TL;DR: ExpertFlow是一个用于MoE推理的运行时系统，通过自适应专家预取和缓存感知路由，显著减少内存传输延迟，将模型停顿时间降低到基线的0.1%以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU内存容量有限限制了大型语言模型的扩展，传统MoE推理方法因频繁参数传输引入高延迟，现有跨层预测策略缺乏跨硬件平台和负载的适应性。

Method: 结合自适应专家预取和缓存感知路由，利用传输带宽、参数维度和模型反馈等运行时统计持续调整预测范围，采用混合跨层预测方案融合预门控信息和中间计算状态来预测未来专家需求。

Result: 评估显示ExpertFlow将模型停顿时间减少到基线的0.1%以下，有效优化了严格内存约束下的MoE推理性能。

Conclusion: ExpertFlow通过自适应预取决策和与实际使用行为的对齐，有效减少了缓存未命中和专家交换引入的延迟，为内存受限环境下的MoE推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The expansion of large language models is increasingly limited by the
constrained memory capacity of modern GPUs. To mitigate this,
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of
parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and
computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which
select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable
latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In
addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based
on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and
workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.
  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE
inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing.
ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by
leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter
dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a
hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with
intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By
adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage
behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency
caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces
model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability
to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.

TL;DR: CHIPSIM是一个用于小芯片系统上并行DNN执行的协同仿真框架，通过同时建模计算和通信，显著提高了仿真精度和热分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单片芯片制造良率下降，无法满足数据密集型应用的计算、内存和通信需求，而小芯片架构提供了成本效益和可扩展性解决方案，但现有仿真方法缺乏所需的精度、速度和灵活性。

Method: 开发了CHIPSIM协同仿真框架，同时建模计算和通信，准确捕捉网络争用和流水线效应，并以微秒级粒度分析小芯片和片上网络功耗，进行精确瞬态热分析。

Result: 在均质/异构小芯片和不同片上网络架构上的广泛评估表明，该框架具有多功能性，精度提升高达340%，并具备功率/热分析能力。

Conclusion: CHIPSIM为小芯片系统上的DNN执行提供了一个准确、快速且灵活的仿真解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Due to reduced manufacturing yields, traditional monolithic chips cannot keep
up with the compute, memory, and communication demands of data-intensive
applications, such as rapidly growing deep neural network (DNN) models.
Chiplet-based architectures offer a cost-effective and scalable solution by
integrating smaller chiplets via a network-on-interposer (NoI). Fast and
accurate simulation approaches are critical to unlocking this potential, but
existing methods lack the required accuracy, speed, and flexibility. To address
this need, this work presents CHIPSIM, a comprehensive co-simulation framework
designed for parallel DNN execution on chiplet-based systems. CHIPSIM
concurrently models computation and communication, accurately capturing network
contention and pipelining effects that conventional simulators overlook.
Furthermore, it profiles the chiplet and NoI power consumptions at microsecond
granularity for precise transient thermal analysis. Extensive evaluations with
homogeneous/heterogeneous chiplets and different NoI architectures demonstrate
the framework's versatility, up to 340% accuracy improvement, and power/thermal
analysis capability.

TL;DR: MIREDO框架通过混合整数规划解决存内计算架构中的数据流优化问题，显著提升深度神经网络性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 存内计算架构虽然能缓解数据移动瓶颈，但由于设计空间庞大和架构约束严格，现有优化方法无法充分利用其潜力，导致理论效率与实际系统效率存在明显差距。

Method: 提出MIREDO框架，将数据流优化建模为混合整数规划问题，采用分层硬件抽象和分析延迟模型来准确反映存内计算系统中的复杂数据传输行为。

Result: 评估结果显示MIREDO显著提升性能，在各种DNN模型和硬件设置下实现高达3.2倍的性能改进。

Conclusion: MIREDO通过联合建模工作负载特性、数据流策略和存内计算特定约束，系统性地探索设计空间，确定最优数据流配置。

Abstract: Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by mitigating data movement
bottlenecks. However, realizing the potential of CIM requires specialized
dataflow optimizations, which are challenged by an expansive design space and
strict architectural constraints. Existing optimization approaches often fail
to fully exploit CIM accelerators, leading to noticeable gaps between
theoretical and actual system-level efficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose the MIREDO framework, which formulates dataflow optimization as a
Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problem. MIREDO introduces a hierarchical
hardware abstraction coupled with an analytical latency model designed to
accurately reflect the complex data transfer behaviors within CIM systems. By
jointly modeling workload characteristics, dataflow strategies, and
CIM-specific constraints, MIREDO systematically navigates the vast design space
to determine the optimal dataflow configurations. Evaluation results
demonstrate that MIREDO significantly enhances performance, achieving up to
$3.2\times$ improvement across various DNN models and hardware setups.

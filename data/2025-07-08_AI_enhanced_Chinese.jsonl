However, state-of-the-art parallel MM algorithms are limited by\ntheir need to process graph edges repeatedly over multiple iterations.\nFurthermore, optimized algorithms often require additional memory for graph\ncontraction or edge filtering. In this paper, we introduce Skipper, an\nincremental asynchronous MM algorithm that (i) processes each edge\ndeterministically and only once, (ii) skips a large fraction of edges during\nprocessing, and (iii) minimizes memory space utilization. Notably, Skipper\nrequires (a) a single pass over the edges, and (b) only a single byte of memory\nspace per vertex. Our evaluation of Skipper, using both real-world and\nsynthetic graphs with up to 161 billion edges, and across three different\ncomputer architectures, shows that Skipper processes only 1.2% of the edges and\ndelivers a 47.1 times average speedup (geometric mean). Moreover, Skipper's\noutput quality is highly competitive, with an average size of 88.6% relative to\nthe output of the Lim-Chung algorithm as a state-of-the-art MM algorithm with\nthe largest output size.", "AI": {"tldr": "Skipper\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u91cf\u5f02\u6b65\u6700\u5927\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u3001\u8df3\u8fc7\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8fb9\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u6700\u5927\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "Skipper\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5355\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u8fb9\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u8fb9\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u5b57\u8282\u5185\u5b58\u6bcf\u9876\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u57281610\u4ebf\u8fb9\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0cSkipper\u4ec5\u5904\u74061.2%\u7684\u8fb9\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534747.1\u500d\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe88.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "Skipper\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

We propose cooperative GC (CoGC), a\nnovel gradient-sharing-based GC framework that leverages cooperative\ncommunication among clients. This approach ultimately eliminates the need for\ndataset replication, making it both communication- and computation-efficient\nand suitable for federated learning (FL). By employing the standard GC decoding\nmechanism, CoGC yields strictly binary outcomes: either the global model is\nexactly recovered, or the decoding fails entirely, with no intermediate\nresults. This characteristic ensures the optimality of the training and\ndemonstrates strong resilience to client-to-server communication failures when\nthe communication channels among clients are in good condition. However, it may\nalso result in communication inefficiency and hinder convergence due to its\nlack of flexibility, especially when communication channels among clients are\nin poor condition. To overcome this limitation and further harness the\npotential of GC matrices, we propose a complementary decoding mechanism, termed\nGC$^+$, which leverages information that would otherwise be discarded during GC\ndecoding failures. This approach significantly improves system reliability\nunder unreliable communication, as the full recovery of the global model\ntypically dominates in GC$^+$. To conclude, this work establishes solid\ntheoretical frameworks for both CoGC and GC$^+$. We provide complete outage\nanalyses for each decoding mechanism, along with a rigorous investigation of\nhow outages affect the structure and performance of GC matrices. Building on\nthese analyses, we derive convergence bounds for both decoding mechanisms.\nFinally, the effectiveness of CoGC and GC$^+$ is validated through extensive\nsimulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoGC\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faGC$^+$\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u68af\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6d88\u9664\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u590d\u5236\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoGC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6GC\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faGC$^+$\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "CoGC\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u901a\u4fe1\u826f\u597d\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u5dee\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1bGC$^+$\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3aCoGC\u548cGC$^+$\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u65ad\u5bf9GC\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction.

Our experiments demonstrate that optimized\nmulti-chiplet architectures from our design framework achieve up to 64.7%\nperformance improvement and 40% power reduction compared to traditional 2.5D\nsystems to execute deep neural network workloads with lower fabrication costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73bb\u7483\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u591a\u82af\u7247\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7535\u6c14\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u603b\u7ebf\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u7845\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u5c01\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\uff08\u7fd8\u66f2\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u70ed\u3001\u7fd8\u66f2\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u5c01\u88c5\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534764.7%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e40%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73bb\u7483\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u591a\u82af\u7247\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u65f6\u5c01\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\u95ee\u9898\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5c01\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u70ed\u3001\u7fd8\u66f2\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u9762\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u82af\u7247\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534764.7%\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u964d\u4f4e40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5236\u9020\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73bb\u7483\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5c42\u591a\u82af\u7247\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7fd8\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

In recent years, the rise of\nlanguages with quantitative (e.g.~probabilistic) features has led to extensions\nof coinductive methods to more refined types of behavioural conformances, most\nnotably notions of behavioural distance. To guarantee soundness of coinductive\nreasoning, one needs to show that the behavioural conformance at hand forms a\nprogram congruence, i.e. it is suitably compatible with the operations of the\nlanguage. This is usually achieved by a complex proof technique known as\n\\emph{Howe's method}, which needs to be carefully adapted to both the specific\nlanguage and the targeted notion of behavioural conformance. We develop a\nuniform categorical approach to Howe's method that features two orthogonal\ndimensions of abstraction: (1) the underlying higher-order language is modelled\nby an \\emph{abstract higher-order specification} (AHOS), a novel and very\ngeneral categorical account of operational semantics, and (2) notions of\nbehavioural conformance (such as relations or metrics) are modelled via\nfibrations over the base category of an AHOS. Our main result is a fundamental\ncongruence theorem at this level of generality: Under natural conditions on the\ncategorical ingredients and the operational rules of a language modelled by an\nAHOS, the greatest behavioural (bi)conformance on its operational model forms a\ncongruence.

System administrators typically bear the\nresponsibility of adjusting these thresholds. To address this challenge,\nreinforcement learning can be used to dynamically adapt to workload changes and\ndifferent architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel data replication\nstrategy for cloud systems that employs reinforcement learning to automatically\nlearn system characteristics and adapt to workload changes. The strategy's aim\nis to provide satisfactory Quality of Service while optimizing a trade-off\nbetween provider profit and environmental impact. We present the architecture\nbehind our solution and describe the reinforcement learning model by defining\nthe states, actions and rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u590d\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9608\u503c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u673a\u5236\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7279\u6027\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5229\u6da6\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u590d\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

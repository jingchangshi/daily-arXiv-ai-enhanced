While peak tera operations per second\n(TOPS) is often used to gauge performance, it poorly reflects real-world\nperformance and typically rather correlates with higher silicon cost. To\naddress this, architects must focus on maximizing compute utilization, without\nsacrificing flexibility. This paper presents the eIQ Neutron efficient-NPU,\nintegrated into a commercial flagship MPU, alongside co-designed compiler\nalgorithms. The architecture employs a flexible, data-driven design, while the\ncompiler uses a constrained programming approach to optimize compute and data\nmovement based on workload characteristics. Compared to the leading embedded\nNPU and compiler stack, our solution achieves an average speedup of 1.8x (4x\npeak) at equal TOPS and memory resources across standard AI-benchmarks. Even\nagainst NPUs with double the compute and memory resources, Neutron delivers up\nto 3.3x higher performance."}

The Shift-Left methodology introduces a pathway toward creating\ndigital twins and fusing multiple design steps, thereby transitioning\ntraditionally sequential, physically-aware processes into virtual design\nenvironments. This shift allows designers to establish stronger correlations\nearlier and optimize designs more effectively.

However, existing\nassertion generation methods primarily rely on information either from the\ndesign specification, or register-transfer level (RTL) code. The former methods\nare typically limited to generating assertions for the top-level design. As the\ntop-level design is composed of different modules without module-level\nspecifications, they are unable to generate deep assertions that target the\ninternal functionality of modules. The latter methods often rely on a golden\nRTL model, which is difficult to obtain. To address the above limitations, this\npaper presents a novel large language model (LLM)-aided verification framework\nnamed DeepAssert. DeepAssert is capable of analyzing the invocation\nrelationships between modules and extracting independent specifications for\neach module with its I/O port information. These extracted specifications are\nsubsequently used to guide LLMs to automatically generate fine-grained deep\nassertions for these modules. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepAssert\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion\nin generating high-quality deep assertions for modules. Furthermore, when\nintegrated with these methods, DeepAssert can enhance the overall quality of\nthe assertions generated. This allows for a more comprehensive and effective\nverification process."}

This work proposes conditional\nprior diffusion for channel estimation, which learns a history-conditioned\nscore to denoise noisy channel snapshots. A temporal encoder with cross-time\nattention compresses a short observation window into a context vector, which\ncaptures the channel's instantaneous coherence and steers the denoiser via\nfeature-wise modulation. In inference, an SNR-matched initialization selects\nthe diffusion step whose marginal aligns with the measured input SNR, and the\nprocess follows a shortened, geometrically spaced schedule, preserving the\nsignal-to-noise trajectory with far fewer iterations. Temporal\nself-conditioning with the previous channel estimate and a training-only\nsmoothness penalty further stabilizes evolution without biasing the test-time\nestimator.

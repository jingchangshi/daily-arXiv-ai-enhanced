Two seminal results established\nimpossibility of a solution in the oblivious robot (OBLOT) model in a\n$(2,0)$-fault system under semi-synchrony and in a $(3,1)$-Byzantine fault\nsystem under asynchrony. Recently, a breakthrough result circumvented the first\nimpossibility result by giving a deterministic algorithm in a $(2,0)$-fault\nsystem under asynchrony in the luminous robot (LUMI) model using 2-colored\nlights. However, a breakthrough result established impossibility of gathering\nin a $(2,1)$-crash system in the LUMI model under semi-synchrony. In this\npaper, we consider a {\\em mobility fault} model in which a robot crash only\nimpacts it mobility but not the operation of the light.\n  We establish four results under asynchrony in LUMI with the mobility fault\nmodel. We show that it is impossible to solve gathering in a $(2,1)$-mobility\nfault system using 2-colored lights, and then give a solution using 3-colored\nlights, which is optimal w.r.t. the number of colors. We then consider an\n$(N,f)$-mobility fault system, $f<N$, both $N,f$ not known, and give two\ndeterministic algorithms that exhibit a nice time-color trade-off: The first\nwith time $O(N)$ using 7-colored lights and the second with time\n$O(\\max\\{\\ell,f\\})$ using 26-colored lights, where $\\ell< N$ is the number of\ndistinct convex layers of robot positions in the initial configuration.\nInterestingly, for $l, f = O(1)$, our result is optimal.

With multicore architectures becoming\ncommonplace, traditional prefetchers are severely challenged. Independent core\noperation creates significant redundancy (up to 20% of prefetch requests are\nduplicates), causing unnecessary memory bus traffic and wasted bandwidth.\nFurthermore, cutting-edge prefetchers such as Pythia suffer from about a 10%\nperformance loss when scaling from a single-core to a four-core system. To\nsolve these problems, we propose CRL-Pythia, a coordinated reinforcement\nlearning based prefetcher specifically designed for multicore systems. In this\nwork, CRL-Pythia addresses these issues by enabling cross-core sharing of\ninformation and cooperative prefetching decisions, which greatly reduces\nredundant prefetch requests and improves learning convergence across cores. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that CRL-Pythia outperforms single Pythia\nconfigurations in all cases, with approximately 12% IPC (instructions per\ncycle) improvement for bandwidth-constrained workloads, while imposing moderate\nhardware overhead. Our sensitivity analyses also verify its robustness and\nscalability, thereby making CRL-Pythia a practical and efficient solution to\ncontemporary multicore systems."}

Recently, advanced and complex data processing has\ngained increasing importance in science experiments. Data processing workflows\ntypically consist of multiple intricate steps, and the precise specification of\nresource requirements is crucial for each step to allocate optimal resources\nfor effective processing. Estimating resource requirements in advance is\nchallenging due to a wide range of analysis scenarios, varying skill levels\namong community members, and the continuously increasing spectrum of computing\noptions. One practical approach to mitigate these challenges involves initially\nprocessing a subset of each step to measure precise resource utilization from\nactual processing profiles before completing the entire step. While this\ntwo-staged approach enables processing on optimal resources for most of the\nworkflow, it has drawbacks such as initial inaccuracies leading to potential\nfailures and suboptimal resource usage, along with overhead from waiting for\ninitial processing completion, which is critical for fast-turnaround analyses.\nIn this context, our study introduces a novel pipeline of machine learning\nmodels within a comprehensive workflow management system, the Production and\nDistributed Analysis (PanDA) system. These models employ advanced machine\nlearning techniques to predict key resource requirements, overcoming challenges\nposed by limited upfront knowledge of characteristics at each step.

In such scenarios, the scale of the data or the\nscale of the graph may exceed the processing capacity of a single machine. This\npaper aims to address the graph construction problem of such scale via\nefficient graph merge. For the graph construction on a single node, two generic\nand highly parallelizable algorithms, namely Two-way Merge and Multi-way Merge\nare proposed to merge subgraphs into one. For the graph construction across\nmultiple nodes, a multi-node procedure based on Two-way Merge is presented. The\nprocedure makes it feasible to construct a large-scale k-NN graph/indexing\ngraph on either a single node or multiple nodes when the data size exceeds the\nmemory capacity of one node. Extensive experiments are conducted on both\nlarge-scale k-NN graph and indexing graph construction. For the k-NN graph\nconstruction, the large-scale and high-quality k-NN graphs are constructed by\ngraph merge in parallel. Typically, a billion-scale k-NN graph can be built in\napproximately 17h when only three nodes are employed. For the indexing graph\nconstruction, similar NN search performance as the original indexing graph is\nachieved with the merged indexing graphs while requiring much less time of\nconstruction."}

However, in extreme environments like In-Network Computing (INC),\nthese limitations become inviolable laws, creating an acute trilemma among\ncommunication efficiency, bounded memory, and robust scalability. Prevailing\ndistributed paradigms, while powerful in their intended domains, were not\ndesigned for this stringent regime and thus face fundamental challenges. This\npaper demonstrates that resolving this trilemma requires a shift in perspective\n- from seeking engineering trade-offs to deriving solutions from logical\nnecessity. We establish a rigorous axiomatic system that formalizes these\nphysical constraints and prove that for the broad class of computations\nadmitting an idempotent merge operator, there exists a unique, optimal\nparadigm. Any system satisfying these axioms must converge to a single normal\nform: Self-Describing Parallel Flows (SDPF), a purely data-centric model where\nstateless executors process flows that carry their own control logic. We\nfurther prove this unique paradigm is convergent, Turing-complete, and minimal.\nIn the same way that the CAP theorem established a boundary for what is\nimpossible in distributed state management, our work provides a constructive\ndual: a uniqueness theorem that reveals what is \\textit{inevitable} for\ndistributed computation flows under physical law."}

While keeping formal guarantees on the standard P2P metrics (routing\npath length, maximum degree), we optimize the network in a demand-aware manner\nand minimize the path lengths weighted by the peer-to-peer communication\ndemands. Our protocol is learning-augmented, meaning that each node receives an\nindividual, possibly inaccurate prediction about the future traffic patterns,\nwith the goal of improving the network's performances. We strike a trade-off\nbetween significantly improved performances when the predictions are correct\n(consistency) and polylogarithmic performances when the predictions are\narbitrary (robustness).\n  We have two main contributions. First, we consider the centralized setting\nand show that the problem of constructing an optimum static skip list network\n(SLN) is solvable in polynomial time and can be computed via dynamic\nprogramming. This problem is the natural demand-aware extension of the optimal\nskip list problem.\n  Second, we introduce the Uniform P2P protocol which generalizes skip list\nnetworks (SLN) by relaxing the node's heights from discrete to continuous.

Existing\ntools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent\nexplosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their\nability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach.\nToward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs\nto translate between parallel languages.\n  In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for\nLLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target\ntranslations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how\nwell current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and\nLLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known\nstrategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization\nfor decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and\niterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation,\nwe construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel\ntranslation and cross-paradigm transformations.\n  Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the\ndefault settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15%\nfunctional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning,\nhyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up\nto 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will\nprovide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the\nparallel language translation problem.\n  UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub\nrepository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI."}

In response to the security issues\nof traditional distributed MoE, we propose a blockchain-aided trustworthy MoE\n(B-MoE) framework that consists of three layers: the edge layer, the blockchain\nlayer, and the storage layer.
